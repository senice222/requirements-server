1
00:00:55,797 --> 00:00:58,277
I want you
to suck my big dick.

2
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:01,644
Marty honey, dinner.

3
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,514
I want you
to lick my balls.

4
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,917
<i>His cock?</i>

5
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:49,487
<i>His cock was beautiful.</i>

6
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,466
And he ate me out
for an hour.

7
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,399
Lisa, you know,

8
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:00,235
it's all about attitude.
If you want it, you can get it.

9
00:02:00,295 --> 00:02:02,639
You just got to get
your fuckin' ass on the beach.

10
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:06,201
- Work for it.
- Whatever.

11
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,624
Excuse me,
sandwich boy?

12
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,497
Aren't you supposed
to wear gloves,

13
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:32,003
'cause I don't know
where those hands have been.

14
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,475
Fuckin' pigs, man!

15
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:45,284
- My name's Marty, what's yours?
- Just give me the sub, asshole.

16
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,412
Ask the bitches to meet us,
fuckhole! We'll party.

17
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:52,185
We're going surfing, at 3:00.

18
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:54,386
If you want to meet us
at North Beach.

19
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:59,688
Maybe we'll think about it.

20
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:02,132
Great, babe,
you can be my date.

21
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,533
My friend here
will take that one.

22
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:05,036
Hey, fuck you, man.

23
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,714
- Those guys were fine.
- He was making fun of me.

24
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:26,020
No shit. He was just being
an asshole. Guys are like that.

25
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,027
But the other one,
the shorter one--

26
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,824
- The cute one.
- Yeah, Marty.

27
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:31,864
He acted like
he wanted to meet you.

28
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,129
- Meet you, you mean.
- No, his buddy's got dibs on me.

29
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,828
His buddy's the boss.

30
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:38,529
I've never been
around such a hunk.

31
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,537
Oh!

32
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,678
- Cute butt.
- Yeah.

33
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,814
He's sweet.
The other one's an asshole.

34
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,172
You wanna go to a party?

35
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:17,432
Sure.

36
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,116
- You're a pretty hot surfer.
- Thanks.

37
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:26,709
You could go pro.

38
00:04:28,443 --> 00:04:30,582
What planet
are you living on?

39
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,817
Earth, fucker!

40
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,918
Compared to you,
he's fuckin' Kobe Bryant.

41
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,672
- What do you guys want?
- Go get a bottle of tequila.

42
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:56,341
Can you give me some money?
I only got six bucks.

43
00:04:56,404 --> 00:04:57,439
What was that, boy?

44
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,452
Was it "Yes sir, boss. I'll buy
that booze for you now?"

45
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,212
What I thought, bitch!

46
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,724
You're an asshole.

47
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:15,299
Baby,
you know what I like.

48
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:19,798
Come on up here. 
I'm starting to dig you a little bit.

49
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,643
Damn, baby.

50
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,761
- Welcome to the party, bitch!
- Fuck!

51
00:05:53,194 --> 00:05:54,901
Take your pants off.

52
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:56,306
Come on, baby.

53
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,241
You're fuckin' beautiful.

54
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:09,321
Back up.

55
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:15,686
Yeah.

56
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:22,360
Good morning.

57
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:35,204
- I got a new boyfriend, Ma.
- A new what?

58
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:39,444
- A new boyfriend.
- A boyfriend?

59
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,707
What kind?

60
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,814
A hunk.

61
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:45,883
Really?

62
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:49,544
Yeah,
you're gonna meet him.

63
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:13,609
I hear your cute friend
gives good phone.

64
00:08:13,668 --> 00:08:17,775
Marty's the best.
He'll make you come in two minutes.

65
00:08:21,943 --> 00:08:24,753
- Can I call him?
- No, he'll call you.

66
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,361
He lives with
his parents, you know.

67
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:36,965
Okay look,
right now...

68
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:40,131
$100 if he gets
on stage and dances.

69
00:08:42,263 --> 00:08:44,334
I hope you know
you're getting up there.

70
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,901
<i>No way, man.
No way.</i>

71
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:48,504
Come on. A hundred bucks
is a hundred bucks.

72
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,480
I can make the money
somewhere else.

73
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:53,917
Get the fuck up there
right now, it's $100.

74
00:08:53,975 --> 00:08:55,181
Go!

75
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,188
Get up there.

76
00:09:07,221 --> 00:09:09,064
Make 'em proud.

77
00:10:24,298 --> 00:10:27,245
160, 180, 200...

78
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:29,372
Plus what you got,
that's 300.

79
00:10:31,873 --> 00:10:33,113
What's the matter, man?

80
00:10:36,077 --> 00:10:38,023
You enjoyed that,
back there, didn't you?

81
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,184
Hell no. I ain't queer
like those guys.

82
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:41,158
Bullshit.

83
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:43,593
Bullshit,
I think you like dick.

84
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:46,427
Ain't got to lie to me, boy.
I know you like dick.

85
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:47,625
Fuck you!

86
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,723
- Look out!

87
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:50,063
- Man!

88
00:10:50,124 --> 00:10:52,968
You fuck, you fucked up
my fuckin' car!

89
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,005
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck!

90
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:56,908
Watch the fuck out!
You're gonna make me wreck!

91
00:10:56,964 --> 00:11:00,571
- You stupid fuck!
- Oh, fuck!

92
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:03,673
- You piece of shit!
- Motherfucker!

93
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:09,680
- Fuck this goddamn shit!

94
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:12,250
Marty?

95
00:11:13,347 --> 00:11:15,054
Hey, get in the car.

96
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,126
Fuck you, man.

97
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,342
I'm sorry, man.
Let's just go.

98
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:37,379
Let's go, I'm sorry.

99
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:39,509
Get your fuckin' hands
off me, Bobby.

100
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:42,211
I'm really sorry.

101
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:45,323
You're my best friend.

102
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:47,885
Okay?

103
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:14,784
Coming inside
or what, Lisa?

104
00:12:14,842 --> 00:12:16,788
No, I'm waiting
for my new boyfriend.

105
00:12:16,844 --> 00:12:18,846
You met Marty,
haven't you, Claudia?

106
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:20,221
No, I don't think so.

107
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,852
- Is he cute?
- He a hunk.

108
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:19,083
- Aaah!
- What the fuck?!

109
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,175
I'm next!

110
00:13:23,744 --> 00:13:24,745
Lover bug?

111
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:29,884
Oh, my God.

112
00:13:36,557 --> 00:13:37,797
Can we move?

113
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:43,403
Haven't we already
discussed this?

114
00:13:43,464 --> 00:13:45,205
Can I have a car, then?

115
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:50,148
Why can't we just move out
of this dumb neighborhood?

116
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,344
Marty,

117
00:13:54,408 --> 00:13:57,878
we can't just quit our jobs and leave
because our son's having problems.

118
00:13:57,945 --> 00:13:59,151
<i>Fine.</i>

119
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,152
Fuck it!

120
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,263
Maybe we could hang.
My cousin gave me some weed.

121
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:47,533
That's cool.

122
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:26,142
First time I ever smoked weed,

123
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:29,347
it was in
the eighth grade,

124
00:15:29,403 --> 00:15:32,247
and I knew a lot of kids
who had been doing <i>it...</i>

125
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,877
but I was always afraid to,

126
00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:37,047
'cause I was raised
strict Catholic.

127
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:40,456
I was taught that the worst
thing you could do in life,

128
00:15:40,514 --> 00:15:42,391
would be to make
your mother cry.

129
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:46,896
She always told me if she caught me
messing with dope it would kill her.

130
00:15:48,255 --> 00:15:51,793
But Bobby... he was
always bugging me about it.

131
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:54,396
It was <i>so</i> fucking
important to him.

132
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:56,999
If he did it,
I had to do it.

133
00:15:57,064 --> 00:15:58,441
<i>So one day...</i>

134
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,572
we were at the bus stop,
waiting for the bus,

135
00:16:02,636 --> 00:16:04,638
and I smoked some
with Bobby.

136
00:16:06,774 --> 00:16:09,880
And he told me
the shit was, like, weak.

137
00:16:09,944 --> 00:16:11,855
That I'd barely
even feel it.

138
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,219
He must have fuckin' dusted
that shit or something, 'cause...

139
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:21,164
the whole fuckin' world
warped around me, man.

140
00:16:21,222 --> 00:16:23,862
I had no idea
how to handle it.

141
00:16:23,924 --> 00:16:26,666
The only thing
I could think to do was run.

142
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:32,803
I take off, Bobby's running
behind me, laughing like crazy.

143
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:36,280
I get home and I get in my bed and
I pull the covers over my head...

144
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:42,318
Like bury myself under a pillow.
I was <i>so</i> fuckin' scared.

145
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,455
Bobby yanks
the covers off of me.

146
00:16:49,783 --> 00:16:52,229
- You know what I did?
- No.

147
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,595
You know what I did?

148
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:57,465
What baby?

149
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,136
I fuckin' pissed
all over myself.

150
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:09,581
I love you, Marty.

151
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:18,819
I love you <i>so</i> much I can't even
believe how much I love you.

152
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:23,126
I would do
anything for you.

153
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:35,425
Hi Lisa. What's up?

154
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,808
Oh, man!

155
00:18:42,863 --> 00:18:45,537
- Whose is it?
- It's Marty's.

156
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,172
Shit. Couldn't it be Bobby's?
Haven't you fucked them both?

157
00:18:50,237 --> 00:18:51,875
No, it's Marty's.

158
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:56,085
She says that
like she actually knows.

159
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:01,657
Watch what he does.
Holy shit!

160
00:19:01,715 --> 00:19:05,288
Watch, he's not done.
Eat his heart, Derek.

161
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,923
Hey, asshole, I don't know
how to eat his heart, nobody does.

162
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,945
I know who your girlfriend is,
your right hand.

163
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,957
- Derek, I need a ride.
- Can't you see I'm busy?

164
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:34,856
I need a ride
over to Marty's.

165
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:40,190
Okay, let's go, cuz.

166
00:19:48,962 --> 00:19:50,305
I need to talk to you.

167
00:19:50,364 --> 00:19:52,071
- Later. I'm busy.
- Now!

168
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,741
What?

169
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:05,616
- Hey dude. What's happening?
- Nothing.

170
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,717
Come on in, let me show you
what me and Marty are working on.

171
00:20:08,782 --> 00:20:10,056
It's definitely cool.

172
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,597
Come here, man.

173
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:16,861
Take a look at this.

174
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,995
We picked up this
guy from the Copa.

175
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,202
Got him to do
all this fucked up shit.

176
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,175
I can't believe
you got a guy to do this.

177
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:28,144
Yeah, it's fuckin'
disgusting.

178
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,915
It's nasty, Dude.

179
00:20:30,971 --> 00:20:32,712
- You and Marty did this?
- Yeah.

180
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,777
We're gonna sell this to porno shops.
They'll pay top dollar for this.

181
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:38,255
This is gross, dude.
I'm gonna wait outside.

182
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:41,415
You don't like
our fuckin' tape?

183
00:20:41,482 --> 00:20:44,122
No, it's gross shit, man.
I don't like it at all.

184
00:20:44,184 --> 00:20:46,061
I don't.
I'm gonna wait outside.

185
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,429
Okay.

186
00:20:54,361 --> 00:20:56,671
I'm not ready to be
no dad, Lisa.

187
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,539
Let go of me,
please!

188
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:01,079
You'll the money
and get it fixed.

189
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:05,049
You fucking hear me,
God damn it?

190
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:08,109
- Huh? Answer me.
- Let go of her, asshole!

191
00:21:08,175 --> 00:21:11,452
- We were just messing around.
- You're just messing around!

192
00:21:11,512 --> 00:21:13,719
Does this look like
messing around, asshole?!

193
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:14,725
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

194
00:21:14,782 --> 00:21:17,626
Jesus Christ, you call
this messing around? Look!

195
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:19,527
- I said I was fuckin' sorry!
- Fuck you!

196
00:21:19,586 --> 00:21:21,896
- Motherfucker!
- Fuck you! Get out of here.

197
00:21:21,955 --> 00:21:23,263
- Bring it, motherfucker!
- Fuck!

198
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,133
- Motherfucker, bring it!
- The fuck is with you?

199
00:21:32,132 --> 00:21:34,043
She's fuckin'
pregnant, man.

200
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:38,577
She's fuckin' pregnant!

201
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:41,909
It's fuckin'...

202
00:21:44,111 --> 00:21:45,647
Little motherfucker!

203
00:21:46,713 --> 00:21:48,454
I'm sending my goddamn
brother over there.

204
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,017
He's gonna beat
the shit out of him.

205
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,926
- I mean beat the living shit--
- No Mama, please.

206
00:21:51,985 --> 00:21:54,795
I love Marty.
I love him more than anything.

207
00:21:58,292 --> 00:21:59,896
I don't understand this.

208
00:22:02,062 --> 00:22:05,066
I don't understand
what is going on with you.

209
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:08,544
Maybe
I don't wanna know.

210
00:22:08,602 --> 00:22:12,311
Please, Ma,
don't get Marty hurt.

211
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,680
<i>Fine.</i>

212
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,085
You need a bath,
young lady.

213
00:22:21,615 --> 00:22:23,492
Clean yourself up!

214
00:23:03,624 --> 00:23:05,194
It's Bobby.

215
00:23:28,215 --> 00:23:29,660
Oh, fuck!

216
00:23:29,716 --> 00:23:33,129
I paged my dealer.
It's gonna be all right.

217
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,191
Hello?

218
00:23:38,258 --> 00:23:41,501
Where you've been, bitch?
I've been calling you forever.

219
00:23:41,561 --> 00:23:45,509
I've been hangin' out with
this guy Donny who's totally hot.

220
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,943
You're still fucking
that surfer?

221
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,807
I heard you're fuckin' pregnant.

222
00:23:52,873 --> 00:23:56,286
Yeah...
we're totally happy.

223
00:23:56,343 --> 00:23:59,722
Guess what? His friend Bobby
is so hot for you,

224
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,421
he wants you to come down
and experiment and shit.

225
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:07,226
He's into some spooky shit
even you wouldn't believe.

226
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:08,265
Really?

227
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,470
I'll see.

228
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,649
ls Bobby nice?
I mean, can he be?

229
00:24:35,716 --> 00:24:37,923
I don't know,
you met him.

230
00:24:37,985 --> 00:24:40,363
He was an asshole
when I met him.

231
00:24:42,923 --> 00:24:46,962
Bobby and I have been friends
since we were almost born, and shit.

232
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,072
Then he must be nice.

233
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:54,435
Yeah, I guess.

234
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,450
I haven't seen
your friend, lately.

235
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,689
I said, I haven't seen
Marty lately.

236
00:25:07,314 --> 00:25:08,952
That's good.

237
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,919
He's probably too busy
with his surfing.

238
00:25:10,984 --> 00:25:13,965
A game that children
play at the beach.

239
00:25:16,923 --> 00:25:18,527
It's a way of life.

240
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,299
Really?

241
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,896
Did your friend Marty
tell you that?

242
00:25:23,497 --> 00:25:24,475
What kind of life <i>is...</i>

243
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,876
splashing around in the waves
and saying " Wheee!"?

244
00:25:31,171 --> 00:25:32,912
May I be excused?

245
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:39,486
No.
Son, you are smart,

246
00:25:39,546 --> 00:25:41,457
you have ambition,
you have presence.

247
00:25:41,515 --> 00:25:45,964
Your friend Marty is living
a life of complete aimlessness.

248
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:49,091
I don't know what happened to him.
He used to be a good kid.

249
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:51,432
He's got no ambition,
no fire in his gut, nothing.

250
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:53,198
I don't want you spending
<i>so</i> much time with him.

251
00:25:55,462 --> 00:25:57,942
I will move this family
far away from here

252
00:25:57,998 --> 00:25:59,636
before I see you
waste your life away.

253
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:01,940
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

254
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:06,845
I booked a piano lesson
for you Thursday.

255

00:30:31,738 --> 00:30:35,049
I told you not to hang out
with him and I meant it.

318
00:30:36,343 --> 00:30:39,449
- I'm thinking about selling the house.
- No, please, Dad.

319
00:30:39,512 --> 00:30:41,822
I won't hang out
with Marty anymore.

320
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:45,294
- I promise.
- Can't you see he's dragging you down?

321
00:30:45,352 --> 00:30:47,161
Dad, yes I do.

322
00:30:49,022 --> 00:30:50,467
I promise I won't
hang out with him.

323
00:30:50,523 --> 00:30:53,436
- Just give me one more chance--
- He didn't even finish high school.

324
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:56,406
I know, he's a loser.
I know that, I see that.

325
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:59,944
They came over to say hello.
That's it, I swear.

326
00:31:02,602 --> 00:31:03,945
Dad.

327
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:08,643
Hey Bob, you know...

328
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:12,517
I saw a stereo place
for sale on the way home.

329
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,525
It was like the one
we talked about,

330
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,118
only it didn't have
the window tinting.

331
00:31:17,183 --> 00:31:18,992
Bobby, you can do it.

332
00:31:19,052 --> 00:31:21,658
You can do it, Bob.
I know you can.

333
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:24,065
I can help you.
I'll get you all set up.

334
00:31:25,225 --> 00:31:28,468
Bobby, it's the best future
you can have in this country.

335
00:31:28,528 --> 00:31:30,201
To be your own master.

336
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:39,550
If I do this for you,
can we hire Marty?

337
00:31:48,348 --> 00:31:50,350
Wow, you're really good.

338
00:31:51,418 --> 00:31:53,591
- Where are you from?
- Michigan.

339
00:31:54,654 --> 00:31:56,793
I used to be better
when I was competing.

340
00:31:56,856 --> 00:31:58,563
Why did you stop?

341
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,871
I don't know.

342
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:07,470
- You be good, little man, all right?
- All right. See you.

343
00:32:19,012 --> 00:32:20,821
What do you want to do?

344
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,486
I wanna ask you
something, Marty.

345
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:27,088
Why do you let Bobby
treat you the way he does?

346
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,461
What?

347
00:32:29,456 --> 00:32:31,436
Why do you let Bobby
treat you like he does?

348
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,630
Hit you and stuff
and make fun of you?

349
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:37,365
He disses you right to your face
in front of everyone.

350
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:42,236
Derek thinks you guys
are queer for each other.

351
00:32:42,302 --> 00:32:44,441
Derek's an asshole.

352
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,539
You know what?

353
00:32:48,308 --> 00:32:50,948
- I love you.
- Shut up.

354
00:32:52,145 --> 00:32:54,284
I do. I love you and
I care about you,

355
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,826
and I don't want
to see you suffer.

356
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,756
I don't wanna see Bobby
picking on you ever again.

357
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,503
Bobby".

358
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,834
What?

359
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:15,106
He's been like this since
we were little fuckin' kids.

360
00:33:16,803 --> 00:33:21,309
He's always been like this.

361
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,878
He's always beat the fuck
out of me, whenever he wanted.

362
00:33:24,944 --> 00:33:28,084
There's not a goddamn thing
I can do about it.

363
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,828
I begged my fuckin'
parents to move--

364
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,694
You could move away yourself.

365
00:33:34,754 --> 00:33:37,530
I'm not even
a high school graduate.

366
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:41,861
Yeah, I know.
Tell me about it.

367
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,811
So there is nothing
we can do to stop him ever.

368
00:33:46,866 --> 00:33:49,107
We could kill him.
That's about it.

369
00:33:52,138 --> 00:33:53,776
That's what
I was thinking.

370
00:33:54,874 --> 00:33:55,852
What?

371
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,112
What are you
talking about?

372
00:34:00,446 --> 00:34:02,983
- Bobby.
- What about Bobby?

373
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,654
What if he was gone?

374
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,299
What kind of weird shit
are you talking about?

375
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:14,966
What if we killed him?

376
00:34:15,028 --> 00:34:17,338
Are you fuckin' nuts?

377
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:23,708
He treats everyone
like shit.

378
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,717
He's always mean,
he's always cruel.

379
00:34:27,807 --> 00:34:29,286
Beats you up.

380
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:34,120
He's even too weird for Ali
and she's into everything!

381
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,151
He's the source of
everybody's troubles.

382
00:34:39,218 --> 00:34:41,755
And even still,
he's gonna finish high school

383
00:34:41,821 --> 00:34:44,131
and go to college
and probably get rich.

384
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,171
Yeah, and I'm gonna be delivering
pizzas to him in Weston.

385
00:34:50,563 --> 00:34:52,668
How would we get a gun?

386
00:34:52,732 --> 00:34:54,405
My ma has one.

387
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,181
Shit,
that motherfucker...

388
00:35:04,444 --> 00:35:06,151
has fuckin' dissed <i>me...</i>

389
00:35:06,212 --> 00:35:09,455
and treated me like shit
my whole goddamn life.

390
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:12,394
Let's kill him.

391
00:35:23,196 --> 00:35:24,732
No shit!

392
00:35:34,374 --> 00:35:37,912
- You are one crazy bitch.
- No I'm not.

393
00:35:37,977 --> 00:35:40,184
No I'm not.
Marty agrees with me.

394
00:35:40,246 --> 00:35:42,920
This is the way for everyone
to take care of their problems,

395
00:35:42,982 --> 00:35:45,622
because Bobby is everybody's
fuckin' problem.

396
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,255
What do you want me to do?

397
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,301
- Come down and help us.
- Oh, man...

398
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,995
Wow. What are you gonna do it with?

399
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,007
I don't know.
A gun or a knife, I guess.

400
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,417
Bitch.

401
00:36:08,474 --> 00:36:09,646
Good.

402
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:14,283
- What are you doing?
- Just talking to my dog.

403
00:36:14,347 --> 00:36:16,827
- Are you high?
- Not enough.

404
00:36:18,584 --> 00:36:20,996
My mom's in here
and she's like--

405
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:24,160
she's like making plans
for my 18th birthday party.

406
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,602
She's gonna have a cake,
a <i>clown</i> and all that shit.

407
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,765
You know, like
when you were a kid.

408
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:32,435
I think
she's happy here.

409
00:36:32,498 --> 00:36:34,535
I think she likes it
a lot better than New Jersey.

410
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,978
I need to talk to you about something.

411
00:36:37,036 --> 00:36:38,515
I've got to go
to Fort Lauderdale

412
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,211
to help my friend Lisa
kill this asshole named Bobby.

413
00:36:41,274 --> 00:36:43,276
I like it
when you pull my hair.

414
00:36:43,342 --> 00:36:44,685
Cool.

415
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,656
Shut up.
You won't kill this guy.

416
00:36:47,714 --> 00:36:49,159
Yeah.

417
00:36:49,215 --> 00:36:51,422
- No.
- Yeah.

418
00:36:51,484 --> 00:36:53,828
- No.
- Yeah.

419
00:36:53,886 --> 00:36:56,059
Kill him?
Like kill him in real life?

420
00:36:56,122 --> 00:36:58,068
- Kill him?
- Yes.

421
00:36:58,124 --> 00:37:00,695
- Like kill him, he's dead?
- Yes.

422
00:37:01,894 --> 00:37:04,534
- No.
- Yes.

423
00:37:06,232 --> 00:37:08,439
Whoa, Ali.
That's some heavy shit.

424
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:10,947
- You want to go with me?

425
00:37:11,003 --> 00:37:12,812
I got some
really good dope in.

426
00:37:12,872 --> 00:37:15,546

- Well okay, sure.

427
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,019
I'll go with you.

428
00:37:17,076 --> 00:37:18,180
- Hello?
- Hey!

429
00:37:18,244 --> 00:37:19,951
Where the fuck
are you, bitch?

430
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,684
Back in rehab.

431
00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:25,059
I'm kind
of messed up, Ali.

432
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,290
Tweak.

433
00:37:27,687 --> 00:37:30,258
Listen, I gotta go down
to Fort Lauderdale,

434
00:37:30,323 --> 00:37:32,769
to help my friend Lisa kill
this asshole named Bobby.

435
00:37:32,825 --> 00:37:35,328
But if you want,
I can come pick you up.

436
00:37:38,498 --> 00:37:39,943
Okay.

437
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:46,150
What if we drive by his house,
when he's in his yard or some shit?

438
00:37:46,205 --> 00:37:48,185
Shoot him down.

439
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:50,721
Cops will think
it's a gang thing.

440
00:37:52,111 --> 00:37:55,251
Shit, Lisa.
That a fuckin' great idea.

441
00:38:19,372 --> 00:38:21,249
Ow! Fuck, man!

442
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,581
Thanks for getting me, Ali.

443
00:38:26,646 --> 00:38:28,683
I stick
with my homies.

444
00:38:28,748 --> 00:38:30,921
Is that joint
all you're holding?

445
00:38:32,118 --> 00:38:34,189
We've got a glove box
full of acid.

446
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,898
Any tweak?

447
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:41,461
How was rehab?

448
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,411
Just about raped Ali
last time she came.

449
00:38:59,512 --> 00:39:01,890
He beats me.
He's raped me.

450
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:04,360
The worst part is the way
he picks on Marty.

451
00:39:04,417 --> 00:39:07,990
He treats him like a dog
or a slave or something.

452
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,761
Pisses me off <i>so</i> bad
I can't stand it.

453
00:39:09,822 --> 00:39:11,802
So, what are you
gonna do, Lisa?

454
00:39:11,858 --> 00:39:13,769
I'm gonna kill him.

455
00:39:13,826 --> 00:39:17,069
- That's some heavy shit.
- Yeah, it is!

456
00:39:17,129 --> 00:39:19,803
How are you gonna do it?

457
00:39:19,866 --> 00:39:22,369
Why are you guys
<i>so</i> serious?

458
00:39:22,435 --> 00:39:24,915
We're gonna fix
Bobby Kent's ass.

459
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,245
Cool!

460
00:39:27,306 --> 00:39:29,684
Holy shit!

461
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,086
Can we get some napkins?

462
00:39:32,144 --> 00:39:34,215
- I'll be back.
- And a straw.

463
00:39:35,648 --> 00:39:37,525
How are we gonna do it?

464
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,223
I was thinking, we could 
drive by his house,

465
00:39:40,286 --> 00:39:43,290
when he's in his yard,
and shoot him down.

466
00:39:43,356 --> 00:39:45,302
The cops will think
it's a gang thing.

467
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:47,201
Oh, no.
Somebody will see us.

468
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,707
I know. We can go into his house
while he's sleeping,

469
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,299
and stab the fucker
in the neck.

470
00:39:52,365 --> 00:39:55,107
- I brought my survival knife.
- He's got a doberman.

471
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:57,147
The best way
is just to shoot him.

472
00:39:57,203 --> 00:39:59,706
- How do we get a gun?
- My ma has one.

473
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:11,326
We can't bonk him over
the head and drag him off somewhere.

474
00:40:11,384 --> 00:40:12,362
<i>How come?</i>

475
00:40:13,419 --> 00:40:14,955
He's too strong.

476
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:17,160
Wait a second.
Haven't you even met him before?

477
00:40:17,223 --> 00:40:19,203
- No.
- No, me neither.

478
00:40:19,258 --> 00:40:22,603
- What's this guy like?
- He's an asshole.

479
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:30,841
Holy shit.
What he fuck is that for?

480
00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:33,543
To kill Bobby Kent,
don't you remember?

481
00:40:33,606 --> 00:40:35,552
Oh, yeah.

482
00:40:35,608 --> 00:40:37,849
Hey, won't that
get blood everywhere?

483
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:40,186
Yeah, we're gonna have to plan
where we're gonna do it.

484
00:40:43,282 --> 00:40:46,320
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Mrs. Connelly.

485
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,963
These are my friends from Palm Bay.
This is Donny and this is Heather.

486
00:40:51,023 --> 00:40:54,232
- Hi, Donny. Hi, Heather.
- Hey.

487
00:40:54,293 --> 00:40:57,103
- Did you kids have supper?
- Yes ma'am.

488
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,903
Okay.

489
00:41:04,437 --> 00:41:06,417
Are we really
gonna do this?

490
00:41:07,373 --> 00:41:10,320
Jesus Christ, Ali, can you
get this guy to shut up?

491
00:41:10,376 --> 00:41:11,377
Ow!

492
00:41:11,444 --> 00:41:12,946
- Shut up, Donny.
- You shut up!

493
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,719
We'll have to find
a way to get him alone.

494
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,623
No shit,
he's gotta be by himself.

495
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:20,596
It's easier to kill someone
when they're by themselves.

496
00:41:20,653 --> 00:41:22,428
Yeah.

497
00:41:22,488 --> 00:41:24,968
Ali, what if you offer
to fuck him again?

498
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:28,301
Wait a minute, isn't this
the guy who raped you?

499
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,602
What do you mean...
like bait?

500
00:41:30,663 --> 00:41:31,767
Yeah.

501
00:41:31,831 --> 00:41:33,538
It's not enough
for him to go.

502
00:41:35,968 --> 00:41:39,040
What if I offered
to let him dog out my 5.0?

503
00:41:39,105 --> 00:41:41,881
- Excuse me--
- And then offer to fuck me again.

504
00:41:41,941 --> 00:41:44,888
He can drive you out to the barrens
in Weston by the Glades.

505
00:41:44,944 --> 00:41:46,548
Wait a second...
Okay?

506
00:41:46,612 --> 00:41:49,092
If Ali's supposed
to be banging Bobby,

507
00:41:49,148 --> 00:41:50,786
then what the fuck
is Donny doing here?

508
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:54,320
Seriously, the guy's
just gonna go and kick it,

509
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,333
while somebody else
screws his chick?

510
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:57,925
Nobody's that big of a dweeb.

511
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:01,369
- He's right.

512
00:42:05,431 --> 00:42:07,411
Holy shit, I could--

513
00:42:07,466 --> 00:42:09,912
We could say that
I'm Heather's boyfriend.

514
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:11,243
<i>You know'?</i>

515
00:42:13,672 --> 00:42:15,174
That's good, right?

516
00:42:20,279 --> 00:42:22,225
- Hey?
- Hey.

517
00:42:22,281 --> 00:42:25,660
- What're you doing?
- Homework.

518
00:42:25,718 --> 00:42:26,856
No shit.

519
00:42:27,853 --> 00:42:30,299
Well, I'm over
at Lisa's house,

520
00:42:30,356 --> 00:42:34,702
and that Ali chick
is down here.

521
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,503
- I think she wants you.
- What are you taking about?

522
00:42:39,665 --> 00:42:40,939
<i>Hold on.</i>

523
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,505
Hey Bob,
what's going on?

524
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,514
Hey!

525
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:48,243
You're not pissed off?

526
00:42:48,307 --> 00:42:51,880
No, I liked it, actually.
I've been thinking about it.

527
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,389
Maybe we could get
together.

528
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:56,859
We could take my 5.0 out
and get ballistic or something.

529
00:43:02,922 --> 00:43:04,162
What's up?

530
00:43:04,223 --> 00:43:06,328
Marty, what's with this shit?

531
00:43:06,392 --> 00:43:08,338
I don't know.
I guess she digs you.

532
00:43:08,394 --> 00:43:11,807
You got me jealous over here.
She's fuckin' fine.

533
00:43:14,934 --> 00:43:16,914
Hey, you're there
with fuckface?

534
00:43:18,771 --> 00:43:22,378
- Yeah.
- Oh. Sick.

535
00:43:24,043 --> 00:43:27,217
Okay, we do it and just roll
the body into the canal.

536
00:43:27,279 --> 00:43:28,986
That's out
by the Glades.

537
00:43:29,048 --> 00:43:31,028
The gators will eat
his ass for lunch.

538
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:32,027
Here.

539
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,792
What are you
giving me that for?

540
00:43:34,854 --> 00:43:36,561
You're in the best
position to do it.

541
00:43:36,622 --> 00:43:38,602
You fuck him, then right
when he's gonna come,

542
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,694
- you blow his brains out.
- Oh, shit.

543
00:43:40,759 --> 00:43:43,740
- That's cool.
- You're the one that wants him dead.

544
00:43:43,796 --> 00:43:45,707
You want him dead too.

545
00:43:45,764 --> 00:43:47,539
It's too risky
if I do it.

546
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,773
I'd have to follow him.
He might hear me coming.

547
00:43:52,037 --> 00:43:54,039
Here, take it.

548
00:43:54,106 --> 00:43:55,642
I'll be close by.

549
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:57,415
You shoot him,
we'll ditch the body.

550
00:43:58,777 --> 00:44:00,984
All right, fuck it.
Let's go!

551
00:44:22,635 --> 00:44:24,808
Hey, Bobby.
I'm Heather's girl--

552
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,247
boyfriend... Fuck!

553
00:44:27,306 --> 00:44:30,185
Hey Don--
uh, Bobby--

554
00:44:30,242 --> 00:44:33,917
I'm Donny, this is Heather--
I'm-- I'm her boyfriend.

555
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:34,957
Yeah.

556
00:44:35,014 --> 00:44:36,084
- That's good?
- Yeah.

557
00:44:36,148 --> 00:44:37,923
I was thinking
we'd go out to Weston

558
00:44:37,983 --> 00:44:39,690
and mess around
in those new developments

559
00:44:39,752 --> 00:44:41,595
and dog out
my 5.0 or some shit.

560
00:44:41,654 --> 00:44:43,725
I'll give these two
a ride back.

561
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:47,361
Wait a second,
you're not coming?

562
00:44:47,426 --> 00:44:50,771
No, man.
I'm fucking worked.

563
00:44:50,829 --> 00:44:52,570
What about her?

564
00:44:52,631 --> 00:44:55,578
- I'm coming with you.
- No, man!

565
00:44:55,634 --> 00:44:58,274
I don't want your bitch
coming along with us.

566
00:44:58,337 --> 00:45:00,613
Come on, Bobby.
She's my homie.

567
00:45:00,673 --> 00:45:03,279
I haven't seen her
in a long time and...

568
00:45:03,342 --> 00:45:06,050
we need to talk about some shit
on the way out anyway.

569
00:45:07,846 --> 00:45:09,018
What?

570
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,754
Hey, Bobby.

571
00:45:10,816 --> 00:45:16,061
I'm Donny, this is Heather.
I'm fucking her.

572
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:20,600
Okay, whatever,
I'm driving.

573
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:35,377
Goodbye, asshole.

574
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,688
You don't want
to dog it out some more?

575
00:45:43,749 --> 00:45:48,323
- I mean, it is a 5.0.
- This ain't a 5.0, bitch.

576
00:45:49,755 --> 00:45:53,259
How about
I dog you out? Huh?

577
00:45:55,861 --> 00:45:58,740
What the fuck did we come
all the way out here for, then?

578
00:46:02,001 --> 00:46:03,173
Fuck!

579
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:08,650
How about you give me
a fucking blow job, now?

580
00:46:11,043 --> 00:46:12,989
What are you fucking
bitches talking about?

581
00:46:14,747 --> 00:46:16,818
I'm going for a walk.

582
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:23,057
Shit, you got a fuckin'
irritating laugh, bitch.

583
00:47:13,005 --> 00:47:16,680
- ...Miss Tennessee.

584
00:47:23,749 --> 00:47:26,889
- So, is he dead?
- Nope, Lisa chickened out.

585
00:47:26,952 --> 00:47:27,896
Fuck I did.

586
00:47:27,953 --> 00:47:32,402
Yo, Marty, check out Miss Texas.
She's <i>so</i> fuckin' hot!

587
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,864
- You couldn't do it?
- No, I just thought of something.

588
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:40,536
On "Homicide" they can take
a bullet out of the body

589
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:42,078
and trace it back
to the murder weapon.

590
00:47:42,134 --> 00:47:44,637
If I use my mom's gun,
they can find out I did it.

591
00:47:44,703 --> 00:47:47,149
- So then toss it!
- Toss what?

592
00:47:47,206 --> 00:47:49,743
The gun, into the ocean, and
then they can't trace the bullet.

593
00:47:49,808 --> 00:47:52,880
I can't do that.
My ma'd kill me.

594
00:47:52,945 --> 00:47:54,652
You're bullshit too,
bitch.

595
00:47:54,713 --> 00:47:57,023
- I am not.
- Are so.

596
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,892
I think you're all
fuckin' bullshit.

597
00:48:07,326 --> 00:48:09,738
You guys need
professional help.

598
00:48:11,964 --> 00:48:13,671
Shit.

599
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,251
What's this shit?

600
00:48:26,311 --> 00:48:29,383
- I thought you were professionals.
- We are fuckin' professionals.

601
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,860
Why are you giving us shit
we can't use?

602
00:48:52,404 --> 00:48:55,010
- Who is it?
- Some girl named Ali.

603
00:48:55,073 --> 00:48:56,575
Ali?

604
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:57,950
Hey, Ali.
What's up?

605
00:48:59,611 --> 00:49:02,217
Sure as hell don't sound
like a sanctioned hit.

606
00:49:05,584 --> 00:49:07,564
You can come over
to talk about it,

607
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:09,565
but nothing's set
in stone, all right?

608
00:49:10,856 --> 00:49:12,130
All right, cool.

609
00:49:46,892 --> 00:49:49,930
- Hey, it's me.
- What do you want?

610
00:49:49,995 --> 00:49:51,906
Derek, I need you
for something big.

611
00:49:51,964 --> 00:49:55,207
- My truck's broken.
- Fuck your truck, I need you.

612
00:49:57,069 --> 00:49:58,548
Then I need a ride.

613
00:50:05,511 --> 00:50:07,388
Come on, come on.

614
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:20,602
- You're in, dude?
- Let's go.

615
00:50:22,261 --> 00:50:24,002
Hey, I'm Heather.

616
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,506
You wanna hit this?

617
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:40,584
So what do you do, man?
What's your thing?

618
00:50:40,646 --> 00:50:42,023
What do you do?

619
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,527
- I do "Combat."
- Oh shit, "Combat"?

620
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,360
I fuckin' love combat.
I like to drop acid and play.

621
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:52,197
That's cool.

622
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,669
So. You got
a place to play at?

623
00:50:54,726 --> 00:50:59,004
Yeah, DNA Comics.
Across the street from Lisa's house.

624
00:50:59,064 --> 00:51:02,568
- Got any acid?
- Yeah I got some acid, bro'.

625
00:51:07,873 --> 00:51:09,409
<i>Open...</i> aaah.

626
00:51:10,475 --> 00:51:11,613
Here you go, man.

627
00:51:15,914 --> 00:51:18,190
All right.
Take us to DNA, Heather.

628
00:51:27,893 --> 00:51:30,169
- Blasted!
- Wasted!

629
00:51:30,228 --> 00:51:31,866
Busted!

630
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:33,637
I think these guys
have been experimenting

631
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:35,474
with some
controlled substances.

632
00:51:35,534 --> 00:51:36,808
You aren't just
whistling dixie.

633
00:51:36,868 --> 00:51:39,872
Come on, get the fuck
out of the way.

634
00:51:39,938 --> 00:51:42,350
Big floppy donkey dick bully.

635
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:46,081
Choose your fighter.

636
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,454
Fight to the death.

637
00:52:01,093 --> 00:52:03,596
- You're Marty, right?
- Yeah.

638
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,164
I've watched you
surf North Beach.

639
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,504
No shit?

640
00:52:06,565 --> 00:52:08,511
I like to rollerblade
down there a lot.

641
00:52:09,601 --> 00:52:11,877
Look like you get a good
workout from rollerblading.

642
00:52:11,937 --> 00:52:13,007
Thanks.

643
00:52:14,072 --> 00:52:15,415
Marty?

644
00:52:15,474 --> 00:52:17,545
You gotta get
back to work.

645
00:52:17,609 --> 00:52:19,088
I'll be there
in a minute, man.

646
00:52:20,879 --> 00:52:23,291
I've never
rollerbladed before.

647
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:27,057
We'll go sometime.
I'll teach you.

648
00:52:29,788 --> 00:52:31,825
Here, let me
give you my number.

649
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:32,925
Please do.

650
00:52:33,992 --> 00:52:36,973
What about your chick
at home, man?

651
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:39,031
That fat bitch
with your baby?

652
00:52:40,766 --> 00:52:42,006
I mean it's--

653
00:52:45,937 --> 00:52:49,009
Well I guess
I should be going now. Bye.

654
00:52:53,512 --> 00:52:55,321
I work right here.

655
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,760
This is my lunch break,
if you ever wanna come visit me.

656
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,490
What a cunt!

657
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,716
- Fatalize.
- Fatalize, fatalize.

658
00:53:24,176 --> 00:53:25,621
Fatalize.

659
00:53:25,677 --> 00:53:28,521
He's gonna hurl.
Oh, shit.

660
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,753
I got it. I got it.

661
00:53:33,852 --> 00:53:37,857
Fucking A, man.
You fucking fatalized the guy.

662
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,669
What the fuck, man--
What the fuck does fatalize mean?

663
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:47,677
- Does it mean death?
- No dude, it's worse.

664
00:53:47,733 --> 00:53:50,475
Way worse, because
you have to live, man.

665
00:53:50,535 --> 00:53:53,482
You have to live and
you're like a fuckin' baby.

666
00:53:53,538 --> 00:53:55,575
Fuck, man!

667
00:53:57,075 --> 00:53:58,315
Shit!

668
00:53:59,845 --> 00:54:03,292
- Let's go help my cousin.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

669
00:54:04,349 --> 00:54:05,327
Shit!

670
00:54:16,595 --> 00:54:19,337
Ew! Gross, yuck!

671
00:54:20,398 --> 00:54:21,638
Sorry.

672
00:54:23,401 --> 00:54:24,778
What's up, guys?

673
00:54:26,371 --> 00:54:27,543
Sorry.

674
00:54:27,606 --> 00:54:31,349
Go away.
Go away right now.

675
00:54:33,211 --> 00:54:35,748
Go away?
Give me a kiss.

676
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,555
No, eeww!

677
00:54:37,616 --> 00:54:41,257
Jesus Christ, you guys
should have seen what Derek did.

678
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:44,528
He turned this guy
into a baby.

679
00:54:44,589 --> 00:54:47,570
Close your mouth
when you eat, Jesus!

680
00:54:47,626 --> 00:54:49,503
Is this like a joke or something?

681
00:54:49,561 --> 00:54:52,041
No, it isn't a joke.
I know this guy, he's in a gang.

682
00:54:52,097 --> 00:54:53,167
A hitman?

683
00:54:54,232 --> 00:54:55,108
No doubt.

684
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:22,938
- Damn it!

685
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:40,084
I got it, Dad.

686
00:55:41,246 --> 00:55:44,955
Shit! Lay off the horn.
You're blasting my whole neighborhood.

687
00:55:46,084 --> 00:55:47,893
What's up, Ali?

688
00:55:47,953 --> 00:55:48,897
Nothing.

689
00:55:48,954 --> 00:55:52,026
We need to know if you can
get those guns for us, man.

690
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:54,536
You need to give me a little time.

691
00:55:54,593 --> 00:55:56,766
<i>Can' t just snap
your fingers and shit.</i>

692
00:55:57,829 --> 00:56:00,935
- Guns are hard to come by.
- I can get you some money.

693
00:56:00,999 --> 00:56:03,639
Oh yeah? Whose piggy bank
are you gonna rob?

694
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,906
Come on, you know
you can trust us.

695
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,551
Why do it with a gun?

696
00:56:13,612 --> 00:56:15,558
lt just seemed like the easy way to do it.

697
00:56:15,614 --> 00:56:18,959
You need to chill out
and plan this out a little better.

698
00:56:19,017 --> 00:56:20,325
No, I wanna do it now.

699
00:56:20,385 --> 00:56:22,490
God damn it, I want
the son of a bitch dead.

700
00:56:22,554 --> 00:56:24,192
I want his sorry ass
dead tonight.

701
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:26,497
Do you understand me?

702
00:56:28,326 --> 00:56:29,930
<i>All right, look...</i>

703
00:56:29,995 --> 00:56:31,975
maybe I can help you,
but I don't know.

704
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,541
First you guys need
some weapons and shit.

705
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,876
You should think about
planning this out better.

706
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,918
Then, when you get all that done,
then you can come see me.

707
00:56:41,973 --> 00:56:44,317
I have a window around the rear.

708
00:56:44,376 --> 00:56:46,686
Just come by and
knock a little lightly.

709
00:56:46,745 --> 00:56:48,315
I'll be there.

710
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:51,589
Like a signal, right?
Like in Tom Sawyer.

711
00:56:57,555 --> 00:57:00,764
My normal suppliers, they won't
help out with this shit.

712
00:57:00,825 --> 00:57:03,465
Maybe I'll just come and
supervise, I don't know.

713
00:57:03,528 --> 00:57:05,633
But either way,
you got a weapons problem.

714
00:57:10,702 --> 00:57:14,149
I swear to God, I can't wait
to stab that motherfucker.

715
00:57:14,205 --> 00:57:17,118
Slit his throat and
bleed him like a pig.

716
00:57:17,175 --> 00:57:19,018
I'm gonna slice
his guts open,

717
00:57:19,077 --> 00:57:21,216
spill his intestines
out on the dirt,

718
00:57:21,279 --> 00:57:22,849
beat him in the head
with a baseball bat

719
00:57:22,914 --> 00:57:24,393
until
his eyeballs fall out.

720
00:57:26,251 --> 00:57:29,630
If you won't do it, I'll do it.
I'll cut the fucker for you.

721
00:57:29,688 --> 00:57:32,931
I'll do it. I'll fuckin'--
I'll kill-- I'll--

722
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,937
I'll do it
if you won't do it.

723
00:57:43,702 --> 00:57:46,444
So weird.
This shit's so weird.

724
00:57:52,644 --> 00:57:55,284
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey, Aunt Mo.

725
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:58,954
Still here, Ali?
Don't you have a baby to take care of?

726
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:02,328
- She's on her way back.
- She should get her stuff and go, then.

727
00:58:03,822 --> 00:58:05,267
You guys don't work.

728
00:58:05,323 --> 00:58:07,997
You don't go to school,
you don't do anything.

729
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:11,700
All you do is lay around
and drive your cars,

730
00:58:11,763 --> 00:58:13,640
and eat us out
of house and home.

731
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:15,439
You know
how that makes me feel?

732
00:58:17,802 --> 00:58:20,373
- Mad!

733
00:58:27,345 --> 00:58:29,256
The fuck are we
gonna do now, man?

734
00:58:29,314 --> 00:58:30,793
Just calm the fuck down.

735
00:58:37,455 --> 00:58:41,904
- Ow, my butt!
- Fuck, Ali. This sucks.

736
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,371
Don't worry about it.

737
00:58:43,428 --> 00:58:45,840
We'll park around the corner
until Lisa's mom leaves.

738
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,804
You're not
with Ali, are you?

739
00:58:52,003 --> 00:58:56,110
- Not unless I lose some weight.
- You've always had common sense.

740
00:58:57,809 --> 00:59:00,722
I'm glad to see you
hanging out with Lisa.

741
00:59:02,347 --> 00:59:04,122
I'm surprised,
but glad.

742
00:59:06,317 --> 00:59:07,728
You like her friends?

743
00:59:10,155 --> 00:59:11,156
I don't know.

744
00:59:12,357 --> 00:59:16,032
I mean, they get a little crazy,
sometimes, but...

745
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,234
I'm just hanging out.

746
00:59:19,297 --> 00:59:20,173
Good.

747
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:24,909
You know, when we lived in the Bronx,
at least we had a family.

748
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:27,847
Family kept things
tight and safe.

749
00:59:28,907 --> 00:59:33,788
Down here in Florida, nobody's tight.
Everybody's just... whatever.

750
00:59:35,146 --> 00:59:38,025
Don't Ali's parents
wonder where she is?

751
00:59:39,084 --> 00:59:40,062
I don't know.

752
00:59:41,486 --> 00:59:44,695
I'm going over to your mother's,
play some cards.

753
00:59:54,499 --> 00:59:55,739
What?

754
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,279
What's the matter?

755
00:59:57,335 --> 01:00:01,408
Nothing, I love you, Ali.
I truly love you.

756
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:03,544
I do too, Ali.

757
01:00:08,012 --> 01:00:10,754
We're gonna be okay,
guys, you know?

758
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:13,591
We're gonna get
this shit behind us and...

759
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:16,461
we're gonna be back
in time in Palm Bay,

760
01:00:16,521 --> 01:00:19,127
for Denny's birthday
at his mom's house.

761
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:22,467
Shit, I never knew nobody
who killed somebody.

762
01:00:24,863 --> 01:00:26,206
Me neither.

763
01:00:27,298 --> 01:00:30,802
Just my grandpa.
I never knew him.

764
01:00:30,869 --> 01:00:32,348
No way?

765
01:00:32,403 --> 01:00:35,441
Yeah. My grandpa
was a bad drunk.

766
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:37,248
Really bad.

767
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:43,588
He'd rape anyone dumb enough
to walk by his room.

768
01:00:43,648 --> 01:00:47,755
One night...
he got...

769
01:00:47,819 --> 01:00:51,323
really pissed at my grandma and
he took a claw hammer to her face.

770
01:00:54,259 --> 01:00:59,641
After that, he locked himself
up with her...

771
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:02,177
in his room
for two whole days...

772
01:01:02,233 --> 01:01:07,307
and he kept drinking and having sex
with her after she was dead.

773
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,352
My mom was in the house
the whole time.

774
01:01:11,409 --> 01:01:15,084
- Fuck.
- She was only 15.

775
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,822
Holy shit.

776
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:24,526
You know, it really
messed with her head.

777
01:01:24,589 --> 01:01:30,562
After that, she only hung out with guys
who beat the hell out of her.

778
01:01:30,628 --> 01:01:32,869
And then,
when I was little,

779
01:01:32,931 --> 01:01:35,241
she'd get drunk and
she'd drag me and my brother

780
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,974
out of bed at four
in the morning and...

781
01:01:38,036 --> 01:01:41,848
she had all the news clippings
about my grandpa...

782
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:45,786
and she'd read them
over and over again.

783
01:01:45,843 --> 01:01:49,791
I knew every word
before kindergarten.

784
01:01:50,882 --> 01:01:52,953
I think that's how
I learned to read.

785
01:01:57,522 --> 01:02:00,002
She's gone.
We should go.

786
01:02:00,992 --> 01:02:04,235
That chick Ali gave me
a blow job, last night.

787
01:02:04,295 --> 01:02:08,505
- And I fucked her.
- Cool.

788
01:02:08,566 --> 01:02:10,409
She called again.

789
01:02:10,468 --> 01:02:12,641
Says you all are going
back out to Weston.

790
01:02:14,205 --> 01:02:15,047
Marty?

791
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:17,586
Yeah man,
that's the plan.

792
01:02:17,642 --> 01:02:18,882
Are you going out?

793
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,818
Hey, man?
You're my best friend.

794
01:02:26,884 --> 01:02:27,862
Right?

795
01:02:28,987 --> 01:02:29,965
Yeah.

796
01:02:50,375 --> 01:02:52,912
Okay, we're picking
Marty up in 45 minutes.

797
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:54,650
Derek, what's up
with the baseball bat?

798
01:02:57,181 --> 01:02:59,127
Come on, we need more weapons.

799
01:03:01,252 --> 01:03:04,256
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

800
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:08,327
- My ma said something?
- No, it's just--

801
01:03:09,427 --> 01:03:11,839
Never mind,
everything's okay.

802
01:03:18,102 --> 01:03:22,050
My back hurts.
I have a tension backache.

803
01:03:22,106 --> 01:03:24,643
Derek, will you
give me a massage?

804
01:03:30,214 --> 01:03:33,661
Me too, my back hurts too.
I want a massage.

805
01:03:33,718 --> 01:03:34,958
Harder.

806
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:37,397
- Like that?
- Hmmm!

807
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:46,237
Watch it!

808
01:03:49,634 --> 01:03:50,772
I guess I'll--

809
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:54,744
Okay, I guess I'll go
do something about the bats.

810
01:03:54,806 --> 01:03:56,251
Good idea.

811
01:04:02,814 --> 01:04:05,055
Okay, there's one thing
left to do.

812
01:04:05,116 --> 01:04:08,723
- What's that?
- The hitman needs a ride.

813
01:04:17,428 --> 01:04:19,374
Where are you going tonight, Bob?

814
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:21,569
Going out
with my friend.

815
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:25,278
Need any money?

816
01:04:25,336 --> 01:04:27,316
No Dad.
I'm cool, thanks.

817
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:47,428
Marty, could I use
your bathroom?

818
01:04:47,492 --> 01:04:49,130
- Number one or two?
- One.

819
01:04:49,193 --> 01:04:50,638
Just go in the alley.

820
01:04:52,897 --> 01:04:54,706
- What's up, man?
- <i>How's</i> it going?

821
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:59,340
CMF, CMF, what the fuck?
What does that mean, CMF?

822
01:04:59,404 --> 01:05:01,315
Didn't we already
tell him what it means?

823
01:05:01,372 --> 01:05:02,646
What's with this guy?

824
01:05:02,707 --> 01:05:05,051
- What does it mean?
- It means Crazy MotherFucker.

825
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:06,850
It's like
"The Godfather"...

826
01:05:06,911 --> 01:05:09,050
- A division of the Davy Boyz.
- Oh, shit!

827
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:12,993
Fuckin' Godfather,
Crazy MotherFuckers. Holy shit!

828
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:14,620
Crazy MotherFuckers, huh?

829
01:05:14,685 --> 01:05:16,358
- Holy shit!
- Hey, man?

830
01:05:16,421 --> 01:05:18,924
- Think this is heavy enough?
- To kill a guy?

831
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:21,869
- Yeah.
- Maybe, if you hit him right.

832
01:05:21,926 --> 01:05:23,337
You mean in the back
of the head or some shit?

833
01:05:23,394 --> 01:05:25,931
It don't matter. You just gotta
hit him hard enough.

834
01:05:25,997 --> 01:05:27,601
Yeah,
I guess that's the key.

835
01:05:27,665 --> 01:05:28,700
Yeah.

836
01:05:28,766 --> 01:05:31,975
You can't just smack the motherfucker,
you've got to really wack him!

837
01:05:32,036 --> 01:05:33,879
It's not like in a fight
and you're mad at him.

838
01:05:33,938 --> 01:05:37,351
You're not trying to hurt him.
You're trying to kill him.

839
01:05:38,409 --> 01:05:39,649
I got something else.

840
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:42,753
See, that's cool!

841
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:44,122
It's Marty, right?

842
01:05:44,182 --> 01:05:45,627
- Yo!
- Yeah.

843
01:05:45,683 --> 01:05:48,664
What about this shit?
This shit is good enough?

844
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:50,426
Right here, right here.

845
01:05:52,256 --> 01:05:54,634
What the fuck for?
You're gonna play baseball?

846
01:05:54,692 --> 01:05:57,400
- No!
- Then why the fuck you got a bat?

847
01:05:57,462 --> 01:05:59,135
What are you
gonna do with that?

848
01:05:59,197 --> 01:06:01,336
- For the guy!
- What guy?

849
01:06:01,399 --> 01:06:02,377
Bobby Kent!

850
01:06:02,433 --> 01:06:04,504
- What about Bobby Kent?
- The guy we're going to kill!

851
01:06:04,569 --> 01:06:08,176
Is this bat good enough
to ram his fuckin' head in?

852
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:10,241
- I don't know, man.
- How about this knife?

853
01:06:10,308 --> 01:06:12,686
This knife is good, right?
I tried to sharpen it but--

854
01:06:12,743 --> 01:06:16,316
- I don't know, man!
- All right, fuck!

855
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:18,951
Are we going
just to fight this guy,

856
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:20,586
or are we gonna
kill him?

857
01:06:20,651 --> 01:06:23,131
I want him dead tonight and
I don't want any bullshit!

858
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:29,194
Yeah, I mean, this is
the son of a bitch that raped Ali.

859
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,797
- He fuckin' raped her!
- Yeah, just think about it.

860
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:33,809
He won't even
let Marty have a life.

861
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:36,539
He beats him every time he does
something Bobby doesn't like.

862
01:06:36,601 --> 01:06:37,477
Do you fuckin' mind?

863
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:39,640
He won't even let him
see his own family.

864
01:06:40,938 --> 01:06:42,417
That sucks.

865
01:06:44,175 --> 01:06:45,654
This guy
deserves to die.

866
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:48,520
He does deserve it.
Agreed.

867
01:06:48,579 --> 01:06:50,320
So we're not just
gonna scare him.

868
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,657
- We're gonna kill him?
- We're gonna kill him!

869
01:06:54,118 --> 01:06:56,064
I want this motherfucker dead,
you understand me?

870
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:59,192
I want this motherfucker dead.

871
01:06:59,257 --> 01:07:03,433
 ♪ Let's fuckin' kill him, fuckin' kill him! ♪

872
01:07:03,494 --> 01:07:06,498
Dead!
Let's kill the motherfucker.

873
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:09,477
- Dead! Dead! Dead!
- Dead.

874
01:07:09,534 --> 01:07:11,639
Dead! We're gonna
kill this fucker.

875
01:07:11,702 --> 01:07:13,204
Dead! Dead!
Dead! Dead--

876
01:07:13,271 --> 01:07:16,184
Oh, shit, sorry. Go ahead.
I'm gonna fuckin' lose it.

877
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,184
Go ahead.

878
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:22,114
You people need to understand
some shit here.

879
01:07:22,179 --> 01:07:23,249
What?

880
01:07:23,314 --> 01:07:24,588
This isn't a game.

881
01:07:24,649 --> 01:07:26,390
We're not a bunch of kids
playing make believe.

882
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:29,056
- Who says we're playing?
- Come down, all right?

883
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,498
You guys got to understand
that me and my people,

884
01:07:31,556 --> 01:07:33,001
we're what you call
serious people.

885
01:07:33,057 --> 01:07:35,094
And you do know what
I mean when I say serious.

886
01:07:35,159 --> 01:07:37,196
- We understand what you--
- What does it mean?

887
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:39,764
- Enlighten me.
- It means you ain't playing.

888
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:42,310
I said from the beginning
that I'd kill this dude.

889
01:07:42,366 --> 01:07:44,073
I was the first one
to say it.

890
01:07:44,135 --> 01:07:46,638
So don't fuckin' treat me
like I'm a kid, okay?

891
01:07:47,705 --> 01:07:48,775
What about you?

892
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:51,979
This guy? Dude, this fuckin'
kid is cold, man.

893
01:07:52,043 --> 01:07:54,819
I've been hangin' out with him
for only a couple days,

894
01:07:54,879 --> 01:07:58,383
I've seen this guy do shit
you wouldn't believe.

895
01:07:59,684 --> 01:08:00,992
He's cold.

896
01:08:01,052 --> 01:08:02,827
All right, that's good.

897
01:08:03,921 --> 01:08:06,128
- Yeah, that's real good.

898
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:07,498
- Hi, Mom!
- Hey, Loverbug.

899
01:08:07,558 --> 01:08:08,935
What are you kids
doing tonight?

900
01:08:08,993 --> 01:08:10,734
Probably going to the movies.

901
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:13,002
- Drive safe, okay?
- I will.

902
01:08:14,365 --> 01:08:16,140
Be careful with my car, honey.

903
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,543
Okay, Mom.

904
01:08:39,056 --> 01:08:40,501
What's going on, man?

905
01:08:40,558 --> 01:08:43,164
You tell me, dude.
Who are these fuckin' assholes?

906
01:08:43,227 --> 01:08:46,003
Just some fuckin' dudes
Ali brought down from Palm Bay.

907
01:08:46,063 --> 01:08:48,805
Some dudes.
What the fuck, man?

908
01:08:48,866 --> 01:08:51,608
I thought you said
she wanted to fuck me.

909
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:53,376
She does, dude.
That's the fuck she wants.

910
01:08:53,437 --> 01:08:54,745
That's all she's been
talking about.

911
01:08:54,805 --> 01:08:56,443
We're just gonna
dog out the rides.

912
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:58,646
See if the Mustang
can take my old lady's ride.

913
01:09:00,311 --> 01:09:02,154
That's fuckin' stupid.

914
01:09:02,213 --> 01:09:04,625
What kind of race
is that, man?

915
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,356
Why don't you chill, Bobby?
Goddamn, dude.

916
01:09:07,418 --> 01:09:10,797
We'll go out to the dunes
where you guys were last time.

917
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:12,835
You didn't do
<i>so</i> bad then, did you?

918
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:13,834
Huh?

919
01:09:15,159 --> 01:09:16,467
All right, man.

920
01:09:25,803 --> 01:09:29,250
Get in the back, bitch.
I'm driving this piece of shit.

921
01:09:32,143 --> 01:09:35,647
Damn.
Keep you in mind.

922
01:09:40,284 --> 01:09:42,389
Show me how
to shift this thing.

923
01:09:45,022 --> 01:09:49,198
- You're <i>so</i> hot!
- I'm not hot, baby, I'm just big.

924
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:55,566
That guy's an asshole
to be driving like that.

925
01:09:55,633 --> 01:09:58,341
Tell me about it.
We've got to kill that fucker.

926
01:09:59,603 --> 01:10:03,813
- All right, I love these dudes.
- I love them too, man.

927
01:10:03,874 --> 01:10:06,582
They're <i>so</i> good. Did you see them
when they were down here?

928
01:10:06,644 --> 01:10:08,521
Fuck yeah, man.
You?

929
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:13,919
I went down to the show with my friend
and we got <i>so</i> fucked up.

930
01:10:13,984 --> 01:10:16,521
So did the whole fuckin'
crowd, man.

931
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:20,296
They had this fat Chinese guy
on stage with them--

932
01:10:20,357 --> 01:10:21,995
Buddha dude! Buddha dude!

933
01:10:22,059 --> 01:10:24,801
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah.
- He was a fuckin' Buddha dude!

934
01:10:24,862 --> 01:10:29,572
He had this huge marijuana leaf
on his stomach, you know?

935
01:10:29,633 --> 01:10:32,773
Yeah, man. Then they played
this one song...

936
01:10:32,837 --> 01:10:35,511
and the whole fuckin' <i>crowd</i>
lit up at once.

937
01:10:35,573 --> 01:10:38,486
Marijuana, just fuckin'
smoking, everybody.

938
01:10:38,542 --> 01:10:40,180
I lit up too.

939
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:43,956
- Right on.
- We might as well get high.

940
01:10:48,018 --> 01:10:50,055
What did that dude
mean earlier when he said

941
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:52,362
he had seen you
do some amazing shit?

942
01:10:52,423 --> 01:10:56,098
Me? I don't know what
that dude thinks he saw me do.

943
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:59,232
- Could be anything.
- Yeah but what exactly?

944
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:01,708
Did you do somebody
or something?

945
01:11:01,766 --> 01:11:04,246
I kind of got down
on a guy earlier today.

946
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:05,609
You killed him?

947
01:11:05,669 --> 01:11:08,548
No, it wasn't anything like that.
It was at the mall.

948
01:11:10,241 --> 01:11:12,346
I put a little
disciplinary action on him.

949
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:15,021
Disciplinary action.

950
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,115
I like that.

951
01:11:17,181 --> 01:11:19,354
You put some
disciplinary action on him.

952
01:11:19,416 --> 01:11:20,588
Yeah.

953
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:28,896
What's your deal, man?
Huh?

954
01:11:28,959 --> 01:11:33,135
- What?
- Why are you here?

955
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:41,147
<i>I am...</i>

956
01:11:43,073 --> 01:11:45,883
He's Heather's boyfriend.
He's here with her.

957
01:11:45,943 --> 01:11:47,581
Yeah.

958
01:11:50,581 --> 01:11:54,393
- You live in Palm Bay?
- Yep.

959
01:11:55,953 --> 01:11:57,762
So why--
I mean what's your--

960
01:11:58,823 --> 01:12:00,666
What's your deal?
Why did you come down?

961
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:03,702
<i>L...</i>

962
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:06,933
I don't know.

963
01:12:08,232 --> 01:12:11,304
To see what a fine looking man 
I'm going out with.

964
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:13,177
- Yeah.

965
01:12:15,306 --> 01:12:18,515
- You call that going out?
- I don't know.

966
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:22,418
I call it
a fuckin' blow job.

967
01:12:23,647 --> 01:12:26,753
Damn fine blow job,
but a blow job all the same.

968
01:12:26,817 --> 01:12:31,027
What do you mean by going out?
What the hell's your definition?

969
01:12:31,088 --> 01:12:34,160
I don't fuckin' know.
What's your name again, Feather?

970
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:37,365
My name's not Feather,
it's Heather.

971
01:12:38,495 --> 01:12:40,907
All right. Let me ask you
a question, Heather.

972
01:12:40,965 --> 01:12:43,411
Are you a hooker here,
like your friend?

973
01:12:43,467 --> 01:12:45,105
- Oh, shit.
- Shit.

974
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:50,010
Huh?

975
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:54,523
You know what?
You better watch your mouth...

976
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:58,116
or my boyfriend
will be real pissed at you.

977
01:12:59,617 --> 01:13:02,097
Who's that?
Lonny back there?

978
01:13:02,152 --> 01:13:04,826
You're talking about Lonny
in the back seat?

979
01:13:04,889 --> 01:13:06,926
He's gonna get mad
at me and then what?

980
01:13:06,991 --> 01:13:09,870
What's he gonna do then?
What are you gonna do, Lonny?

981
01:13:11,395 --> 01:13:12,601
It's Donny, dude.

982
01:13:14,665 --> 01:13:17,043
It's definitely Donny.

983
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:19,513
Yeah, whatever. You know
your girlfriend's a hooker?

984
01:13:20,671 --> 01:13:21,615
For real.

985
01:13:22,673 --> 01:13:25,984
That teen prostitution bust,
two years back?

986
01:13:26,043 --> 01:13:29,217
They were 14,
they got busted.

987
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,317
That was these two holes
turning tricks

988
01:13:31,382 --> 01:13:33,555
for crusty old men
at $100 a pop.

989
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:36,260
For real.

990
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,858
Marty tells me you guys have turned
a few tricks yourselves.

991
01:13:42,693 --> 01:13:43,865
What?

992
01:13:45,229 --> 01:13:47,903
Is that what Marty Puccio
said about me?

993
01:13:55,172 --> 01:13:57,982
So? We're gonna beat
the shit out of this guy or what?

994
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:03,686
I don't know, bro'.
They say they want to kill him.

995
01:14:10,587 --> 01:14:13,864
- How do think it's gonna go down?
- You're talking to me?

996
01:14:13,924 --> 01:14:16,632
Yeah, we got what?
You, me, Donny and Derek.

997
01:14:16,694 --> 01:14:18,037
Wait, who's Donny?

998
01:14:18,095 --> 01:14:20,132
Ali's boyfriend
from Palm Bay.

999
01:14:20,197 --> 01:14:22,768
Geez! That guy's
fuckin' retarded.

1000
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:25,746
No, he just gets high a lot.
He's as normal as you and me.

1001
01:14:25,803 --> 01:14:27,749
Shit, that may not be
saying too much.

1002
01:14:29,139 --> 01:14:31,710
We brought you here 'cause
you're supposed to be the gangster,

1003
01:14:31,775 --> 01:14:34,255
- and the hitman and all that.
- Yeah.

1004
01:14:34,311 --> 01:14:36,313
- Well?
- Well?

1005
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:37,882
So, what do we do?

1006
01:14:37,948 --> 01:14:40,394
We're gonna need a plan,
like a signal.

1007
01:14:40,451 --> 01:14:42,829
The fuck you mean,
like a signal?

1008
01:14:42,886 --> 01:14:46,060
You get the guy out here
telling you're gonna race cars,

1009
01:14:46,123 --> 01:14:47,932
but the real reason
he's here is for the bitch.

1010
01:14:47,992 --> 01:14:50,802
- The bitch?
- He thinks he's gonna fuck Ali.

1011
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:54,070
We need to get Ali
to lead him off somewhere,

1012
01:14:54,131 --> 01:14:55,667
and then we'll
sneak up from behind.

1013
01:14:55,733 --> 01:14:58,270
- Then we give the signal.
- And then what?

1014
01:14:58,335 --> 01:14:59,643
Then we kill him.

1015
01:15:00,738 --> 01:15:03,742
- So, what's the signal?
- I don't know.

1016
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:06,981
We'll have to wait 'til I get there,
<i>so</i> I can check out the scene.

1017
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:08,682
This has
to be done right.

1018
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,599
Let's take a walk.

1019
01:15:19,289 --> 01:15:20,734
<i>Let's do it.</i>

1020
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:44,049
He's gonna tell us what to do.

1021
01:15:44,114 --> 01:15:46,958
Yeah,
I got a few ideas.

1022
01:15:47,017 --> 01:15:49,930
I can't believe we're doing this.
My adrenaline's--

1023
01:15:49,987 --> 01:15:51,432
Shut the fuck up,
Donny!

1024
01:15:51,488 --> 01:15:53,365
You shouldn't yell like that.

1025
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:56,371
It's not like someone's
gonna hear us out here.

1026
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:58,270
You know what?
You shouldn't yell...

1027
01:15:58,328 --> 01:16:01,741
because someone could hear and
think someone's getting killed--

1028
01:16:01,799 --> 01:16:03,574
I'll keep that
in mind, Heather.

1029
01:16:03,634 --> 01:16:05,341
Who else has a weapon?

1030
01:16:08,572 --> 01:16:09,949
You still got that knife?

1031
01:16:10,007 --> 01:16:11,452
- Yeah.
- So get it out!

1032
01:16:13,577 --> 01:16:15,056
Do you plan
on doing anything?

1033
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,456
Fuckin' right.

1034
01:16:18,715 --> 01:16:21,696
So what?
What do you want us to do?

1035
01:16:21,752 --> 01:16:23,698
I don't know.
What do you wanna do?

1036
01:16:23,754 --> 01:16:27,099
- I want this fucker dead now.
- I understand that.

1037
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:29,694
Here's what I think
we should do.

1038
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,764
We're gonna need a signal,
<i>so</i> Heather...

1039
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:35,367
you walk down there like
you're gonna talk to them.

1040
01:16:35,432 --> 01:16:38,641
When you see that everything's okay,
that he doesn't suspect shit...

1041
01:16:38,702 --> 01:16:41,945
then you yell out "Are there
any alligators down there?"

1042
01:16:42,005 --> 01:16:44,212
When we hear that,
we'll know it's time.

1043
01:16:48,212 --> 01:16:50,590
- Alligators in where?
- In the canal.

1044
01:16:50,647 --> 01:16:51,819
It's a signal.

1045
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:55,387
Just say something about alligators,
all right? Then we'll do him.

1046
01:16:55,452 --> 01:16:58,865
I say "alligators"
and then you'll come.

1047
01:16:58,922 --> 01:17:00,731
Yeah,
it's a signal.

1048
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:02,361
- You.
- Yeah.

1049
01:17:02,426 --> 01:17:04,929
Go down there like you're her boyfriend,
hold your hand or some shit.

1050
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:07,168
When you hear
that signal, do it!

1051
01:17:07,231 --> 01:17:08,938
- Okay.
- So, go!

1052
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:10,205
All right!

1053
01:17:12,136 --> 01:17:14,514
- What do you want me to do?
- You back 'em up.

1054
01:17:18,509 --> 01:17:19,453
Go!

1055
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:22,423
We'll back them from up here,
<i>so</i> he can't get away.

1056
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:37,700
Uh, yeah...

1057
01:17:37,761 --> 01:17:41,368
Are there
any alligators in there?

1058
01:17:42,499 --> 01:17:43,637
What?

1059
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:46,510
She asked if there were any alligators.

1060
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:50,108
I don't know. Why don't you go
skinny-dip to find out?

1061
01:17:52,176 --> 01:17:54,452
I asked him if there were
any alligators in there.

1062
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:01,959
Motherfucker!

1063
01:18:04,922 --> 01:18:06,230
God damn it!

1064
01:18:07,724 --> 01:18:08,896
Marty!

1065
01:18:13,163 --> 01:18:14,403
Marty!

1066
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:26,949
Please Marty, please!

1067
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:29,650
Please, whatever I did,
I'm sorry!

1068
01:18:29,713 --> 01:18:30,919
Just go!

1069
01:18:46,129 --> 01:18:47,870
He can't get away!

1070
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:50,070
Get him!

1071
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:08,494
Finish him!
Go, go!

1072
01:19:20,497 --> 01:19:23,569
Turn your goddamn
lights off, Ali!

1073
01:19:33,577 --> 01:19:35,022
- What do you want?
- Get out.

1074
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:37,818
Get fuckin' out!

1075
01:19:39,549 --> 01:19:40,823
Help me carry him.

1076
01:19:41,618 --> 01:19:43,757
Why are you standing around

1077
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:45,493
instead of doing
what I tell you to do!?

1078
01:19:47,257 --> 01:19:49,533
- Is he dead?
- Shut up, Heather.

1079
01:19:49,593 --> 01:19:51,504
- Help me pick him up.
- Why?

1080
01:19:51,561 --> 01:19:53,768
Because we gotta get him
out of sight, asshole!

1081
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:56,538
- Is he dead?
- The fucker's definitely dead.

1082
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,206
They just beat his head in
with a baseball bat.

1083
01:19:59,269 --> 01:20:02,842
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I don't wanna get blood on my shirt.

1084
01:20:02,906 --> 01:20:05,182
We're not gonna
hug him, asshole!

1085
01:20:06,743 --> 01:20:08,586
Grab his feet,
I'll grab his arms.

1086
01:20:12,716 --> 01:20:13,820
What do you wanna do
with him?

1087
01:20:13,884 --> 01:20:15,795
Throw him in the canal.
The gators will get him.

1088
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:18,628
By the time anyone gets here,
there'll be nothing left to find.

1089
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:19,929
Cool.

1090
01:20:21,158 --> 01:20:22,193
Lift!

1091
01:20:23,827 --> 01:20:26,706
- Can we go?
- Just shut up!

1092
01:20:28,732 --> 01:20:30,302
- Now what, asshole?
- What?

1093
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:32,040
This is not too good.

1094
01:20:35,238 --> 01:20:36,876
Why isn't he dead?

1095
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:41,286
Just throw him in the water, man.
This kid isn't gonna swim.

1096
01:20:48,585 --> 01:20:49,928
Is he dead yet?

1097
01:20:51,154 --> 01:20:52,189
Getting there.

1098
01:21:01,965 --> 01:21:03,410
Take me home now.

1099
01:21:05,535 --> 01:21:06,809
Where's everybody going?

1100
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:08,543
Where do you think
we're going, Disneyland?

1101
01:21:08,605 --> 01:21:10,676
- We're going home!
- Bullshit!

1102
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:13,847
Let me tell you.
We better get our alibis straight.

1103
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:17,221
- I ain't having this pinned on me!
- Right, but we gotta leave

1104
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,486
before someone finds us.

1105
01:21:18,548 --> 01:21:20,550
We'll go to the mall
near my house

1106
01:21:20,617 --> 01:21:22,893
and chill out there and
get our stories straight.

1107
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:27,560
Marty, you're okay?

1108
01:21:52,249 --> 01:21:54,752
That shit didn't go down right.
People weren't cool!

1109
01:21:54,818 --> 01:21:57,162
We can't go to the mall.

1110
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:59,632
There's too many kids
hanging out there.

1111
01:21:59,689 --> 01:22:01,464
How about North Beach?

1112
01:22:01,525 --> 01:22:03,766
We chill out and get our shit
together about the alibi.

1113
01:22:03,827 --> 01:22:05,101
You better tell them.

1114
01:22:09,599 --> 01:22:11,010
North Beach.

1115
01:22:22,779 --> 01:22:24,884
You shouldn't
feel bad, Ali.

1116
01:22:25,982 --> 01:22:27,620
He deserved to die.

1117
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:31,929
He would have hurt you,
or your baby.

1118
01:22:34,090 --> 01:22:35,034
What do you mean?

1119
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:39,231
I don't know.
I don't know, I--

1120
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:45,712
I just don't think you should have
a guilt trip or something.

1121
01:22:45,769 --> 01:22:46,713
No?

1122
01:22:57,214 --> 01:22:59,285
It smells like blood.

1123
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:01,329
What? You're crazy.
I don't smell anything.

1124
01:23:01,384 --> 01:23:03,159
It smells like blood.
You can smell it.

1125
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:05,200
I don't smell it.

1126
01:23:05,255 --> 01:23:08,236
Lisa says she smells blood,
then she smells blood.

1127
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:09,361
People are different.

1128
01:23:10,427 --> 01:23:11,997
It fucking stinks.

1129
01:23:12,062 --> 01:23:14,008
What does blood
smell like, anyway?

1130
01:23:15,799 --> 01:23:19,872
I don't know.
But it reeks!

1131
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,971
Lisa?

1132
01:23:23,507 --> 01:23:24,713
What is it, baby?

1133
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:28,545
I forgot the sheath
to my diving knife.

1134
01:23:28,612 --> 01:23:31,058
No, you put it behind the bushes,
I saw you.

1135
01:23:31,114 --> 01:23:32,115
Yeah.

1136
01:23:34,084 --> 01:23:36,428
- You didn't get it?
- No.

1137
01:23:38,021 --> 01:23:41,468
- I can't go back.
- You have to.

1138
01:23:41,525 --> 01:23:43,903
Marty, they can find
the fingerprints.

1139
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,463
But there can be
people there by now.

1140
01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:48,237
Jesus fuckin' Christ,
what now?

1141
01:23:48,298 --> 01:23:51,472
I got to go back.
I left my sheath back there.

1142
01:23:51,535 --> 01:23:53,208
We're gonna have
to go back anyway.

1143
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:54,578
We didn't cover
the tire tracks,

1144
01:23:54,638 --> 01:23:56,174
people might have left
other shit out there.

1145
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:58,082
We just freaked!
We left too fast.

1146
01:23:58,141 --> 01:24:02,453
- I can't go back there.
- We're not asking you.

1147
01:24:02,512 --> 01:24:03,490
Ali?

1148
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:13,533
You were his best friend.
You'll be the number one suspect.

1149
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:17,402
That doesn't make sense.
I should be the last they suspect.

1150
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:20,930
You're not a cop!
You don't know how they think.

1151
01:24:20,997 --> 01:24:25,002
They suspect you even if you look
like the most innocent person.

1152
01:24:25,068 --> 01:24:29,539
The more innocent you seem, the more
they get off on fucking with you.

1153
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:31,085
They get off on that shit.

1154
01:24:34,844 --> 01:24:35,845
We're here.

1155
01:24:38,181 --> 01:24:40,286
- Do you think there's--
- Shhh!

1156
01:24:46,222 --> 01:24:47,200
Ready?

1157
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:50,370
Let's make
this shit fast.

1158
01:24:50,427 --> 01:24:54,671
Police planes stealth around here,
looking for raves and vandals.

1159
01:25:01,304 --> 01:25:04,114
- Sorry.

1160
01:25:17,687 --> 01:25:19,689
Jesus, man!
Don't do that.

1161
01:25:19,756 --> 01:25:21,895
- Any luck?
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

1162
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:23,562
We need to see
if he's still there.

1163
01:25:24,628 --> 01:25:27,700
- What the fuck are you--
- No man, we're here right now!

1164
01:25:27,764 --> 01:25:29,641
We need to see
if anybody's found him yet.

1165
01:25:35,238 --> 01:25:36,376
Over here!

1166
01:25:42,812 --> 01:25:45,884
- Fuck is that?
- Crabs. They're eating him.

1167
01:25:48,084 --> 01:25:52,555
- That's fuckin' sick. That's gross.

1168
01:25:53,623 --> 01:25:55,261
Nature sucks.

1169
01:26:02,198 --> 01:26:03,871
There is blood
on my shoe.

1170
01:26:03,933 --> 01:26:05,537
There's blood
on my fuckin' shoe!

1171
01:26:06,903 --> 01:26:09,884
Some dog is gonna come down
and dig this stuff up.

1172
01:26:09,939 --> 01:26:11,885
People do that.
They bring their dogs here.

1173
01:26:11,941 --> 01:26:14,581
Even though it's illegal.
The lifeguards don't do shit.

1174
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:16,783
If someone finds this stuff.

1175
01:26:16,846 --> 01:26:18,848
- If someone finds this stuff--
- Chill, Lisa.

1176
01:26:20,083 --> 01:26:22,063
You didn't do anything.

1177
01:26:22,118 --> 01:26:25,429
I was there, you didn't do
anything. Neither did I.

1178
01:26:25,488 --> 01:26:26,523
Okay?

1179
01:26:27,824 --> 01:26:28,825
I definitely didn't.

1180
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:31,395
- What?

1181
01:26:31,461 --> 01:26:33,532
I didn't kill anybody.
I just went along for the ride.

1182
01:26:33,596 --> 01:26:36,941
- You fuckin' drowned the guy!
- I only helped carry the body

1183
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,310
'cause that Mafia guy
was gonna beat me.

1184
01:26:39,369 --> 01:26:41,576
- I didn't do shit.
- Neither did I.

1185
01:26:41,638 --> 01:26:43,982
- You stabbed him first!
- Fuck you!

1186
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:48,216
- The blade went in like that much.
- What about the other 10 times?

1187
01:26:51,047 --> 01:26:53,118
God damn it, Lisa!
Give me the bat back.

1188
01:26:53,183 --> 01:26:55,163
I got to return it
or I gotta pay for it.

1189
01:27:22,378 --> 01:27:23,516
Where are the knives?

1190
01:27:25,014 --> 01:27:28,621
- I threw them in the ocean.
- You threw them where in the ocean?

1191
01:27:28,685 --> 01:27:31,131
The bitch's been going postal
ever since you left.

1192
01:27:31,187 --> 01:27:32,461
She's crazy, thinks
she's gonna get caught.

1193
01:27:32,522 --> 01:27:34,160
No,
I didn't do shit!

1194
01:27:34,224 --> 01:27:35,999
If anyone gets caught,
it'll be you.

1195
01:27:36,059 --> 01:27:37,367
You stabbed him first.

1196
01:27:37,427 --> 01:27:38,838
Shut up!
I didn't do shit.

1197
01:27:38,895 --> 01:27:41,569
So we've been talking about
getting caught, and who did what.

1198
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:44,271
That's a great talk to have.
We need to have that talk.

1199
01:27:44,334 --> 01:27:46,007
So, what have you
decided?

1200
01:27:52,475 --> 01:27:54,546
You, doper?
What do you think?

1201
01:27:54,611 --> 01:27:56,557
Did you kill
that motherfucker?

1202
01:27:56,613 --> 01:27:57,591
<i>No.</i>

1203
01:27:57,647 --> 01:28:00,958
I mean, I stabbed the dude.
I admit that.

1204
01:28:01,017 --> 01:28:03,554
Everyone saw me do that.
But I didn't--

1205
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:05,429
I didn't actually
kill him.

1206
01:28:05,488 --> 01:28:07,832
He was still alive after
I finished sticking him.

1207
01:28:07,891 --> 01:28:09,302
You saw the fucker run.

1208
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:10,429
And you?

1209
01:28:11,861 --> 01:28:13,704
You know
I didn't kill him.

1210
01:28:13,763 --> 01:28:15,970
Who helped me drown
the son of bitch, then?

1211
01:28:16,032 --> 01:28:18,706
- He was dead already.
- Oh, he was dead?

1212
01:28:18,768 --> 01:28:20,975
He was <i>so</i> far
fuckin' gone, man.

1213
01:28:22,038 --> 01:28:24,040
I just picked him up
to help you move him.

1214
01:28:24,107 --> 01:28:27,850
I didn't--
I didn't kill anybody.

1215
01:28:29,412 --> 01:28:30,356
Ladies?

1216
01:28:32,382 --> 01:28:34,521
Of course not!
You had nothing to do with it,

1217
01:28:34,584 --> 01:28:36,427
you were just
our dates, correct?

1218
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,361
<i>Me and Mr. Marty
have spoken...</i>

1219
01:28:39,422 --> 01:28:41,959
on the way to retrieving the sheath
that was left at the scene.

1220
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:44,938
The murder scene. You understand
that we murdered somebody?

1221
01:28:44,994 --> 01:28:46,496
We took
your friend's life!

1222
01:28:46,563 --> 01:28:48,236
I wanna make sure
we're on the same page.

1223
01:28:50,366 --> 01:28:51,970
I know you fuckin'
smokeheads.

1224
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:53,571
You're having
your thrills and shit.

1225
01:28:53,636 --> 01:28:55,274
This is no fucking
video game.

1226
01:28:55,338 --> 01:28:57,511
Your friend you were
<i>so</i> very pissed at,

1227
01:28:57,574 --> 01:28:59,110
he's lying face down
in the swamp,

1228
01:28:59,175 --> 01:29:01,951
with his eyes hanging out
and the crabs eating him.

1229
01:29:02,011 --> 01:29:04,013
I don't intend on going down
for this shit.

1230
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:08,051
If any of you take me down,
I will kill his ass, or her ass.

1231
01:29:08,117 --> 01:29:10,893
We're gonna sit on
this beach, right now,

1232
01:29:10,954 --> 01:29:14,094
and work out this alibi
until I'm satisfied with it.

1233
01:29:14,157 --> 01:29:15,397
You've reached the Kents.

1234
01:29:15,458 --> 01:29:17,335
Please leave your name
and number at the beep.

1235
01:29:17,393 --> 01:29:19,134
We'll get back to you
as soon as we can.

1236
01:29:19,195 --> 01:29:20,299
Have a good day.

1237
01:29:20,363 --> 01:29:22,969
Bobby,
this is Marty Puccio.

1238
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,773
I called you.

1239
01:29:25,835 --> 01:29:29,612
You asked me to call
when I got home, <i>so</i> I'm calling.

1240
01:29:29,672 --> 01:29:30,707
Marty?

1241
01:29:50,326 --> 01:29:53,535
You think they could say
I was guilty of it?

1242
01:29:53,596 --> 01:29:55,007
I guess.

1243
01:29:57,634 --> 01:29:59,443
You stabbed him
in the heart.

1244
01:29:59,502 --> 01:30:02,415
When you were on top of him
and he was on his back.

1245
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:06,780
No shit! I had that Mafia guy
with a baseball bat

1246
01:30:06,843 --> 01:30:08,948
telling me
what to do every minute.

1247
01:30:09,012 --> 01:30:10,685
Yeah, that's true.

1248
01:30:12,015 --> 01:30:14,586
I guess they'd say
he did it.

1249
01:30:15,685 --> 01:30:19,098
No shit, Lisa! The guy bashed
his brains out with a ball bat.

1250
01:30:21,557 --> 01:30:22,627
Oh shit!

1251
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:27,131
That was <i>so</i> gross!

1252
01:30:27,196 --> 01:30:30,734
And the guy goes like--
and the shit just--

1253
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,473
<i>That was so sick!</i>

1254
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:40,084
You don't think
I could get in trouble?

1255
01:30:41,511 --> 01:30:42,819
For what?

1256
01:30:45,114 --> 01:30:47,321
For being there,
like an accessory?

1257
01:30:49,752 --> 01:30:53,165
They could say that you were
a witness, but that's about it.

1258
01:30:53,222 --> 01:30:54,997
That's no big deal.

1259
01:31:00,196 --> 01:31:02,039
So,
how do you feel?

1260
01:31:03,299 --> 01:31:05,973
- If we don't get caught?
- Yeah.

1261
01:31:06,035 --> 01:31:10,848
Shit, babe! I feel like
a ton of bricks got lifted off me.

1262
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:15,015
We did it.

1263
01:31:18,214 --> 01:31:20,421
We killed a guy.

1264
01:31:52,382 --> 01:31:54,521
Hey man, I heard.
You're off the chain!

1265
01:31:54,584 --> 01:31:56,257
- What?
- You're out of hand.

1266
01:31:56,319 --> 01:31:57,457
The fuck
you're talking about?

1267
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,591
Fatalize, man.
Fatalize.

1268
01:32:02,892 --> 01:32:06,533
I don't know, man.
I'm just <i>so</i> uptight.

1269
01:32:06,596 --> 01:32:09,099
I can't sleep or do shit...
It's like--

1270
01:32:10,266 --> 01:32:13,736
I'm worried they're gonna find
some shit that's gonna give us away.

1271
01:32:13,803 --> 01:32:15,840
I'm gonna...
get caught.

1272
01:32:17,006 --> 01:32:19,782
I'm <i>so</i> fucked!
I just--

1273
01:32:19,842 --> 01:32:21,185
I just can't stop
thinking about it.

1274
01:32:22,512 --> 01:32:24,219
You didn't kill
that dude, did you?

1275
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:26,419
No! Hell no! I didn't have
shit to do with it.

1276
01:32:26,482 --> 01:32:27,825
But I was there.

1277
01:32:27,884 --> 01:32:30,091
Someone could say
I was a witness.

1278
01:32:30,153 --> 01:32:34,226
I don't know. Maybe if you just know
that something like this happened,

1279
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:36,463
and you don't tell the cops,
they have some fuckin' law,

1280
01:32:36,526 --> 01:32:38,665
some fine print that
could get you in trouble.

1281
01:32:38,728 --> 01:32:43,609
Like leaving the scene
of an accident and not reporting it.

1282
01:32:43,666 --> 01:32:45,509
Yeah, they have that
in driver's ed.

1283
01:32:45,568 --> 01:32:48,481
I know.
So, shit!

1284
01:32:49,472 --> 01:32:51,748
It's like... I just--

1285
01:32:51,808 --> 01:32:53,082
I need an alibi, man.

1286
01:32:54,577 --> 01:32:56,989
I need someone to say
I was with him, so--

1287
01:32:57,046 --> 01:32:58,821
so, I could be like,

1288
01:32:58,881 --> 01:33:01,191
"No... I wasn't anywhere near
those assholes that night.

1289
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:02,923
I was nowhere near them."

1290
01:33:02,985 --> 01:33:04,760
Say this to who?

1291
01:33:04,821 --> 01:33:06,528
To the cops.

1292
01:33:08,257 --> 01:33:11,602
I need someone to say
I was with them.

1293
01:33:17,834 --> 01:33:20,838
What kind of asshole is gonna lie
to the cops about a murder?

1294
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:32,789
Hey Lisa.
What's up?

1295
01:33:33,950 --> 01:33:36,794
You're not gonna believe this shit.
You're not gonna believe it.

1296
01:33:36,853 --> 01:33:38,161
We killed Bobby.

1297
01:33:38,221 --> 01:33:39,427
Pardon me?

1298
01:33:40,690 --> 01:33:42,397
We killed him, he's dead.
We did it.

1299
01:33:43,526 --> 01:33:46,871
You should've seen it.
Marty stuck him right in the heart.

1300
01:33:46,929 --> 01:33:48,909
Lisa, what are you
talking about?

1301
01:33:48,965 --> 01:33:52,003
No shit, listen.

1302
01:33:52,068 --> 01:33:54,207
You know that guy Donny?

1303
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:56,181
You know, the loser?
You met him.

1304
01:33:58,774 --> 01:34:02,153
He stuck him right
in the back of the head.

1305
01:34:02,211 --> 01:34:04,088
Lisa, what?

1306
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:07,354
It's <i>so</i> weird.

1307
01:34:07,416 --> 01:34:10,488
This hitman, right?
He takes his baseball bat...

1308
01:34:10,553 --> 01:34:12,829
and right when Bobby's
on the ground--

1309
01:34:13,856 --> 01:34:15,802
he's like gurgling
like a baby--

1310
01:34:15,858 --> 01:34:19,305
shooting blood and
his guts are hanging out--

1311
01:34:21,097 --> 01:34:22,303
and his eyes--

1312
01:34:23,366 --> 01:34:26,040
It was <i>so</i> sick, his eyes were
popping out of his head.

1313
01:34:26,102 --> 01:34:28,810
He takes his baseball bat
and he swings it,

1314
01:34:28,871 --> 01:34:30,942
and he half caves
in his head.

1315
01:34:31,007 --> 01:34:32,645
You watched this?

1316
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:34,654
Yeah, I was there.
And Ali and Heather.

1317
01:34:35,778 --> 01:34:36,756
We were all there.

1318
01:34:36,812 --> 01:34:39,053
And we saw it,
most of it.

1319
01:34:39,115 --> 01:34:41,095
Heather,
you met her, right?

1320
01:34:42,485 --> 01:34:44,487
She's <i>so</i> strange.

1321
01:34:44,554 --> 01:34:47,228
She gets that blank look,
like she's not even there.

1322
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:50,396
And she starts hugging
her knees and rocking...

1323
01:34:50,459 --> 01:34:53,167
like she's totally fried.
And then, after...

1324
01:34:53,229 --> 01:34:55,732
<i>she just shrugs
and says “Fuck them.“</i>

1325
01:35:04,907 --> 01:35:06,818
- Lisa--
- Listen, Claudia.

1326
01:35:08,044 --> 01:35:09,990
I'm really worried
about how we left him.

1327
01:35:10,046 --> 01:35:12,322
He's just out there,
where anyone can see him.

1328
01:35:12,381 --> 01:35:14,122
I can't stop thinking
about it, you know?

1329
01:35:15,985 --> 01:35:18,522
Like someone walking up
and finding him.

1330
01:35:19,689 --> 01:35:23,000
We should've hid him better,
pushed him in the canal more.

1331
01:35:23,059 --> 01:35:26,700
At least the gators would've got him
or he would have sunk, but--

1332
01:35:26,762 --> 01:35:28,435
That's why I came over.

1333
01:35:28,497 --> 01:35:29,475
What?

1334
01:35:30,533 --> 01:35:33,275
Claudia,
I need to go out there.

1335
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:36,643
Can you borrow your mother's car?
I need a ride.

1336
01:35:36,706 --> 01:35:38,310
I need someone
to help me move it.

1337
01:35:38,374 --> 01:35:40,581
- It?
- The body.

1338
01:35:43,045 --> 01:35:46,993
- You murdered Bobby Kent?
- I didn't say I murdered anybody.

1339
01:35:47,049 --> 01:35:51,293
They killed him.
I won't even say they murdered him.

1340
01:35:51,354 --> 01:35:54,563
- He was fighting back.
- He was?

1341
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:56,433
Yeah!
He was trying to get away.

1342
01:35:56,492 --> 01:35:58,972
Begging Marty.
You know,

1343
01:35:59,028 --> 01:36:04,000
saying, "I'm sorry, please.
I'll do anything, don't kill me."

1344
01:36:04,066 --> 01:36:05,807
Right when he said that,

1345
01:36:05,868 --> 01:36:07,973
Marty walked up to him

1346
01:36:08,037 --> 01:36:10,677
and whacked him in the heart
with his diving knife.

1347
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:13,914
The whole thing
was just totally extreme!

1348
01:36:15,745 --> 01:36:17,281
Oh. Wait.

1349
01:36:17,346 --> 01:36:20,384
You want somebody to take you
out there to move a body?

1350
01:36:20,449 --> 01:36:23,896
I don't" anybody crazy
enough to do that--

1351
01:36:23,953 --> 01:36:27,423
Fine, fine.
We won't go move it.

1352
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:30,937
We'll just go out there see
if the tire tracks are gone.

1353
01:36:30,993 --> 01:36:33,269
No way, Lisa.
No way.

1354
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:35,570
- Come on!
- No!

1355
01:36:35,631 --> 01:36:38,271
Look, I gotta go.
I'm late for work.

1356
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:40,405
I'm supposed to be
in Pizza Hut in half an hour.

1357
01:36:40,469 --> 01:36:44,246
Well, screw you, Claudia.
All I wanted was a ride--

1358
01:36:45,408 --> 01:36:48,912
I hope you have a problem someday,
<i>so</i> you can ask me for help.

1359
01:36:48,978 --> 01:36:50,013
Shit!

1360
01:36:51,814 --> 01:36:54,055
You don't have to make
a federal case out of it.

1361
01:36:54,116 --> 01:36:55,789
I just asked
for a fuckin' ride.

1362
01:36:56,919 --> 01:36:59,229
Claudia, keep your fuckin' mouth shut.

1363
01:37:06,629 --> 01:37:08,575
Was that Lisa leaving?

1364
01:37:08,631 --> 01:37:09,803
Yeah.

1365
01:37:09,865 --> 01:37:12,277
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah!

1366
01:37:12,335 --> 01:37:15,544
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

1367
01:37:15,604 --> 01:37:17,880
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

1368
01:37:17,940 --> 01:37:19,886
I gotta go to work, Mom.

1369
01:37:23,479 --> 01:37:26,858
Mom, what if you witnessed
a crime, like a murder,

1370
01:37:26,916 --> 01:37:30,363
and you called the hotline
but didn't give your name.

1371
01:37:30,419 --> 01:37:31,955
Would that be legal?

1372
01:37:32,021 --> 01:37:33,796
I don't know
what you mean, Ali.

1373
01:37:33,856 --> 01:37:36,200
What kind of a crime?

1374
01:37:36,258 --> 01:37:37,669
A murder,
I told you.

1375
01:37:39,261 --> 01:37:41,502
What are you kids
up to, Ali?

1376
01:37:41,564 --> 01:37:43,544
I was just asking,
for Christ's sakes.

1377
01:37:43,599 --> 01:37:45,601
I mean,
would it still count?

1378
01:37:45,668 --> 01:37:47,409
You could still say
you reported it, right?

1379
01:37:49,105 --> 01:37:52,279
If you saw a murder,
and just called the hotline,

1380
01:37:52,341 --> 01:37:54,821
and reported it and didn't give
your name or anything,

1381
01:37:54,877 --> 01:37:57,949
- would that be enough?
- Would it?

1382
01:37:58,013 --> 01:38:02,257
I don't know the law, but...
I don't think so.

1383
01:38:02,318 --> 01:38:04,798
I think you would still
have to say who you were.

1384
01:38:04,854 --> 01:38:07,391
- But why wouldn't it--
- Why are you asking these questions?

1385
01:38:07,456 --> 01:38:10,994
Why wouldn't it count?
You could still say you reported it.

1386
01:38:12,261 --> 01:38:14,707
Ali, are you talking about
a "murder" murder?

1387
01:38:15,765 --> 01:38:18,769
I guess.
This guy kind of got killed.

1388
01:38:18,834 --> 01:38:21,314
Why would you
just call a hotline?

1389
01:38:21,370 --> 01:38:23,941
I was just asking, God!

1390
01:38:39,688 --> 01:38:40,928
Hello?

1391
01:38:40,990 --> 01:38:42,731
Marty,
where have you been?

1392
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:44,897
Somebody made an anonymous
call to the cops.

1393
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,496
They know about Bobby.

1394
01:38:46,562 --> 01:38:49,236
- Have they found him?
- I don't know.

1395
01:38:49,298 --> 01:38:51,141
Somebody told them
he got murdered.

1396
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:53,441
- Murdered?
- That's what they said.

1397
01:38:53,502 --> 01:38:56,005
- They used that word?
- Yes!

1398
01:38:57,540 --> 01:38:59,486
Did you fuckin'
talk to somebody?

1399
01:38:59,542 --> 01:39:02,523
No, I didn't talk
to anybody, Jesus!

1400
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:41,749
- You're up early.
- I'm going to the skate park.

1401
01:40:42,978 --> 01:40:45,015
What did you do
with the earring?

1402
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:46,582
It fell out.

1403
01:41:15,744 --> 01:41:17,223
I love you, buddy.

1404
01:41:18,347 --> 01:41:19,758
Yeah,
I love you too.

1405
01:41:30,225 --> 01:41:31,829
Who the fuck
did you tell, Lisa?

1406
01:41:31,894 --> 01:41:34,374
It wasn't me, bitch.
For all I know, it's you.

1407
01:41:34,430 --> 01:41:36,376
The cops are onto us,
we have to come up there.

1408
01:41:36,432 --> 01:41:37,877
Not with police on you,
you don't.

1409
01:41:37,933 --> 01:41:39,810
You gotta hide us.

1410
01:41:40,936 --> 01:41:43,815
They know how Bobby
died and everything.

1411
01:41:43,872 --> 01:41:45,579
We're all
in this together, right?

1412
01:41:56,785 --> 01:41:59,629
- Alice, geez!
- It's okay!

1413
01:41:59,688 --> 01:42:02,328
It's all right.
I've got it under control.

1414
01:42:02,391 --> 01:42:04,371
I don't want them
to know where I sleep.

1415
01:42:04,426 --> 01:42:08,135
- This is going to stop, right now.
- Move me in my own apartment then.

1416
01:42:08,197 --> 01:42:10,768
- An apartment?
- Godfucking damn it!

1417
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:14,110
We need to hide because they're
gonna come to your house.

1418
01:42:14,169 --> 01:42:16,308
Baby, who are they?

1419
01:42:16,372 --> 01:42:19,615
Alice seems to think that
some of her friends killed somebody.

1420
01:42:20,709 --> 01:42:23,121
Who in the hell,
Virginia?

1421
01:42:23,178 --> 01:42:25,749
- That is something for the police.
- No police, because

1422
01:42:25,814 --> 01:42:27,657
a Mafia hitman did this.

1423
01:42:27,716 --> 01:42:30,458
He said that if we told
anybody, he'd kill us.

1424
01:42:30,519 --> 01:42:33,193
Is this about getting
your own apartment?

1425
01:42:33,255 --> 01:42:36,702
- No! I don't want an apartment!
- Hey! Honey, hey.

1426
01:42:36,759 --> 01:42:38,238
Fuck.

1427
01:42:38,293 --> 01:42:39,499
- Don't touch me!
- Baby--

1428
01:42:39,561 --> 01:42:41,234
- Baby!
- Don't touch me!

1429
01:42:41,296 --> 01:42:43,799
- Ali, chill!

1430
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:47,376
- That's it.
- He's not in the Mafia.

1431
01:42:47,436 --> 01:42:49,040
You don't know what you're talking about.

1432
01:42:49,104 --> 01:42:51,311
- He must be protecting you.
- Protecting me?

1433
01:42:51,373 --> 01:42:53,649
I'm his brother.
That lazy fucker protects dick.

1434
01:42:53,709 --> 01:42:55,586
He doesn't have a job.

1435
01:42:55,644 --> 01:42:57,555
What about
the Crazy Motherfuckers?

1436
01:42:57,613 --> 01:42:59,650
He wanted to be in Davy Boyz
but chickened out.

1437
01:42:59,715 --> 01:43:01,251
Got the tattoo instead.

1438
01:43:01,316 --> 01:43:03,193
You ought
to turn yourselves in.

1439
01:43:06,055 --> 01:43:08,661
But if I turn my self in,
I may go to jail.

1440
01:43:08,724 --> 01:43:10,965
She's afraid
they'll put her in jail.

1441
01:43:11,026 --> 01:43:14,473
- Tell her you'll write to her.
- Hey man, I'll write to you.

1442
01:43:35,317 --> 01:43:38,821
- Good toss, Laura--

1443
01:43:43,726 --> 01:43:45,637
Sheriff's office!
Where is Marty?

1444
01:43:45,694 --> 01:43:47,696
Where is he?
Let's go!

1445
01:43:53,736 --> 01:43:55,545
Sheriff's office,
don't move.

1446
01:43:55,604 --> 01:43:57,777
- Where's Marty?
- In the bedroom.

1447
01:44:04,012 --> 01:44:05,685
- Sheriff's office!
- What's going on?

1448
01:44:05,748 --> 01:44:08,251
Does the name
Bobby Kent ring a bell?

1449
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:19,061
Hurry.

1450
01:45:09,611 --> 01:45:13,559
I'm due in seven weeks. If it's a boy,
I'll name him Marty.

1451
01:45:15,484 --> 01:45:17,395
Will you send me
a picture?

1452
01:45:17,452 --> 01:45:18,487
Yeah.

1453
01:45:18,554 --> 01:45:21,160
Are they gonna
let you out to have it?

1454
01:45:21,223 --> 01:45:23,225
Shut up, bitch.
You're a fuckin' snitch.

1455
01:45:23,292 --> 01:45:25,033
You cut a deal.
We all know that.

1456
01:45:26,094 --> 01:45:27,198
Is it true?

1457
01:45:28,297 --> 01:45:31,073
Shit, Ali. You don't know that yet?

1458
01:45:31,133 --> 01:45:33,613
Jesus,
who is your lawyer?

1459
01:45:33,669 --> 01:45:37,173
Her and Dumbo here have been
snitching on us to save their asses,

1460
01:45:37,239 --> 01:45:39,082
otherwise
we wouldn't be here today.

1461
01:45:39,141 --> 01:45:42,486
Psst! Sorry ass snitch
motherfucker!

1462
01:45:42,544 --> 01:45:43,955
I know
what you're doing.

1463
01:45:44,012 --> 01:45:47,050
- You're gonna regret this.
- Leave him alone, asshole!

1464
01:45:47,115 --> 01:45:48,651
You've done enough
to ruin his life.

1465
01:45:48,717 --> 01:45:50,162
Shut the fuck up!

1466
01:45:50,219 --> 01:45:53,496
- Your fat cousin ruined it.
- I don't know what I'm doing here.

1467
01:45:53,555 --> 01:45:55,728
I didn't do shit.
I don't know why I'm here.

1468
01:45:55,791 --> 01:45:56,769
You stabbed him, dude.

1469
01:45:57,826 --> 01:45:58,827
What are
you crying about?

1470
