Woman:
Marty honey, dinner.

3
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,014
I want you
to lick my balls.

<i>Girl: His cock?</i>

5

<i>His cock was beautiful.</i>

6
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,966
And he ate me out
for an hour.

7
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,899
Lisa, you know,

8
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,735
it's all about attitude.
If you want it, you can get it.

9
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,139
You just got to get
your fuckin' ass on the beach.

- Work for it.
- Lisa: Whatever.

11
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,124
Excuse me,
sandwich boy?

12
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,997
Aren't you supposed
to wear gloves,

13
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:40,503
'cause I don't know
where those hands have been.

14
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,975
Fuckin' pigs, man!

15

- My name's Marty, what's yours?
- Just give me the sub, asshole.

16
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,912
Ask the bitches to meet us,
fuckhole! We'll party.

17
00:02:56,976 --> 00:03:00,685
We're going surfing,
at 3:00.

18

If you want to meet us
at North Beach.

19
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,188
Maybe we'll think about it.

20
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,632
Great, babe,
you can be my date.

21
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,033
My friend here
will take that one.

22

Hey, fuck you, man.

23

- Those guys were fine.
- He was making fun of me.

24
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,520
No shit. He was just being
an asshole. Guys are like that.

25
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,527
But the other one,
the shorter one--

26
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,324
- The cute one.
- Yeah, Marty.

27
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,364
He acted like
he wanted to meet you.

28
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,629
- Meet you, you mean.
- No, his buddy's got dibs on me.

29
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,328
His buddy's the boss.

30
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,029
I've never been
around such a hunk.

Oh!

32

- Cute butt.
- Yeah.

33
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,314
He's sweet.
The other one's an asshole.

34
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,672
Boy: You wanna go
to a party?

35
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:25,932
Sure.

36
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,616
- You're a pretty hot surfer.
- Thanks.

37
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,209
You could go pro.

38

What planet
are you living on?

Earth, fucker!

40

Compared to you,
he's fuckin' Kobe Bryant.

41

- Marty: What do you guys want?
- Go get a bottle of tequila.

42
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,841
Can you give me some money?
I only got six bucks.

43
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:05,939
What was that, boy?

44
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,952
Was it "Yes sir, boss. I'll buy
that booze for you now?"

45
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,712
What I thought, bitch!

46
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,224
You're an asshole.

47
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,799
Baby,
you know what I like.

48
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:28,298
Boy: Come on up here. I'm starting
to dig you a little bit.

Good morning.

- I got a new boyfriend, Ma.
- A new what?

61
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,944
- A new boyfriend.
- A boyfriend?

Mother: What kind?

63
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,314
A hunk.

I hear your cute friend
gives good phone.

Marty's the best.
He'll make you come in two minutes.

69
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,253
- Can I call him?
- No, he'll call you.

70
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,861
He lives with
his parents, you know.

71
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,465
Okay look,
right now...

$100 if he gets
on stage and dances.

73
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,834
I hope you know
you're getting up there.

<i>No way, man.
No way.</i>

75
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,004
Come on. A hundred bucks
is a hundred bucks.

76
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,980
I can make the money
somewhere else.

77
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,417
Get the fuck up there
right now, it's $100.

Marty: First time
I ever smoked weed,

132
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,847
it was in
the eighth grade,

133
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,747
and I knew a lot of kids
who had been doing <i>it...</i>

134
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,377
but I was always afraid to,

135
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,547
'cause I was raised
strict Catholic.

136
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,956
I was taught that the worst
thing you could do in life,

137
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,891
would be to make
your mother cry.

138

She always told me if she caught me
messing with dope it would kill her.

But Bobby“ he was
always bugging me about it.

It was <i>so</i> fucking
important to him.

I had to do it.

we were at the bus stop,
waiting for the bus,

144
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,138
and I smoked some
with Bobby.

145
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,380
And he told me
the shit was, like, weak.

146
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,355
That I'd barely
even feel it.

147
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,719
He must have fuckin' dusted
that shit or something, 'cause...

148
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:29,664
the whole fuckin' world
warped around me, man.

149

I had no idea
how to handle it.

The only thing
I could think to do was run.

151

I take off, Bobby's running
behind me, laughing like crazy.

I get home and I get in my bed and
I pull the covers over my head...

when I met him.

244

317
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,066
- Say it!
- ( girl crying )

318
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,640
Fucking like that!

319
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,242
Say it! Say it.

320
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:37,184
Say I'm the best.
Say it--

321
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,585
Girl crying: You're
the best I ever had.

322
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,919
- Say it!
- You're the best I ever had.

323
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,983
- Say it louder!
- ( crying )

324
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,358
- Say it louder!
- Best I ever had.

325
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:57,738
So, how was it?
I told you he's a stud.

326
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,242
Yeah, more
like a goddamn queer.

327
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,574
The fucker
just raped me.

328
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,409
Shit, Ali, make up
your fuckin' mind.

329
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,915
I told you he was kinky.

330
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,190
- Hi, Mr. Kent.
- Where's my son?

331
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:31,870
God damn it, he probably
showed her that queer shit.

332
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:43,549
I told you not to hang out
with him and I meant it.

333
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,949
- I'm thinking about selling the house.
- No, please, Dad.

334
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,322
I won't hang out
with Marty anymore.

335
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:53,794
- I promise.
- Can't you see he's dragging you down?

336
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,661
Dad, yes I do.

337
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,967
I promise I won't
hang out with him.

338
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,936
- Just give me one more chance--
- He didn't even finish high school.

339
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,906
I know, he's a loser.
I know that, I see that.

340
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,444
They came over to say hello.
That's it, I swear.

341
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:12,445
Dad.

342
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,143
Hey Bob, you know...

343
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:21,017
I saw a stereo place
for sale on the way home.

344
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,025
It was like the one
we talked about,

345
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,618
only it didn't have
the window tinting.

346
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:27,492
Bobby, you can do it.

347
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,158
You can do it, Bob.
I know you can.

348
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,565
I can help you.
I'll get you all set up.

349
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,968
Bobby, it's the best future
you can have in this country.

350
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,701
To be your own master.

351
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:48,050
If I do this for you,
can we hire Marty?

352
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,850
Wow, you're really good.

353
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,091
- Where are you from?
- Michigan.

354
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:05,293
I used to be better
when I was competing.

355
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,063
Why did you stop?

356
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,371
I don't know.

357
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,970
- You be good, little man, all right?
- All right. See you.

358
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,321
What do you want to do?

359
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,986
I wanna ask you
something, Marty.

360
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:35,588
Why do you let Bobby
treat you the way he does?

361
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:36,961
What?

362
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,936
Why do you let Bobby
treat you like he does?

363
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,130
Hit you and stuff
and make fun of you?

364
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,865
He disses you right to your face
in front of everyone.

365
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,736
Derek thinks you guys
are queer for each other.

366
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,941
Derek's an asshole.

367
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,039
You know what?

368
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,448
- I love you.
- Shut up.

369
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,784
I do. I love you and
I care about you,

370
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,326
and I don't want
to see you suffer.

371
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,256
I don't wanna see Bobby
picking on you ever again.

372
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,003
Bobby".

373
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,334
Lisa: What?

374
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:23,606
He's been like this since
we were little fuckin' kids.

375
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:29,809
He's always been like this.
( sobbing )

376
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:33,378
He's always beat the fuck
out of me, whenever he wanted.

377
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:36,584
There's not a goddamn thing
I can do about it.

378
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,328
I begged my fuckin'
parents to move--

379
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,194
Lisa: You could
move away yourself.

380
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:46,030
I'm not even
a high school graduate.

381
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,361
Yeah, I know.
Tell me about it.

382
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,311
So there is nothing
we can do to stop him ever.

383
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,607
We could kill him.
That's about it.

384
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,276
That's what
I was thinking.

385
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,352
What?

386
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,612
What are you
talking about?

387
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,483
- Lisa: Bobby.
- What about Bobby?

388
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,154
What if he was gone?

389
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,799
What kind of weird shit
are you talking about?

390
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,466
What if we killed him?

391
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,838
Are you fuckin' nuts?

392
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,208
He treats everyone
like shit.

393
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,217
He's always mean,
he's always cruel.

394
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,786
Beats you up.

395
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:42,620
He's even too weird for Ali
and she's into everything!

396
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,651
He's the source of
everybody's troubles.

397
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:50,255
And even still,
he's gonna finish high school

398
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,631
and go to college
and probably get rich.

399
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,671
Yeah, and I'm gonna be delivering
pizzas to him in Weston.

400
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,168
Marty:
How would we get a gun?

401
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,905
Lisa:
My ma has one.

402
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:11,681
Shit,
that motherfucker...

403
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,651
has fuckin' dissed <i>me...</i>

404
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:17,955
and treated me like shit
my whole goddamn life.

405
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:20,894
Let's kill him.

406
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,232
Marty: No shit!

407
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:46,412
- Ali: You are one crazy bitch.
- Lisa: No I'm not.

408
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,684
No I'm not.
Marty agrees with me.

409
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:51,420
This is the way for everyone
to take care of their problems,

410
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,122
because Bobby is everybody's
fuckin' problem.

411
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,755
What do you want me to do?

412
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,801
- Come down and help us.
- Oh, man...

413
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,495
Ali: Wow. What are you
gonna do it with?

414
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,507
I don't know.
A gun or a knife, I guess.

415
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,917
Donny: Bitch.

416
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,146
Good.

417
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:22,783
- Ali: What are you doing?
- Just talking to my dog.

418
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,327
- Are you high?
- Not enough.

419
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,496
My mom's in here
and she's like--

420
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,660
she's like making plans
for my 18th birthday party.

421
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:36,102
She's gonna have a cake,
a <i>clown</i> and all that shit.

422
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,265
You know, like
when you were a kid.

423
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,935
I think
she's happy here.

424
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:43,035
I think she likes it
a lot better than New Jersey.

425
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,478
Lisa: I need
to talk to you about something.

426
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,015
I've got to go
to Fort Lauderdale

427
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,711
to help my friend Lisa
kill this asshole named Bobby.

428
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,776
I like it
when you pull my hair.

429
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,185
Donny: Cool.

430
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,156
Donny: Shut up.
You won't kill this guy.

431
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,659
Ali: Yeah.

432
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,922
- Donny: No.
- Yeah.

433
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,328
- No.
- Yeah.

434
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,559
Donny: Kill him?
Like kill him in real life?

435
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,568
- Donny: Kill him?
- Ali: Yes.

436
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,195
- Like kill him, he's dead?
- Yes.

437
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,034
- No.
- Yes.

438
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,939
Whoa, Ali.
That's some heavy shit.

439
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,447
- You want to go with me?
- ( Donny chuckling )

440
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,312
I got some
really good dope in.

441
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,046
- ( Cell phone ringing)
- Well okay, sure.

442
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:25,519
I'll go with you.

443
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,680
- Hello?
- Girl: Hey!

444
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,451
Where the fuck
are you, bitch?

445
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,184
Girl:
Back in rehab.

446
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,559
I'm kind
of messed up, Ali.

447
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:34,790
Girl: Tweak.

448
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,758
Ali: Listen, I gotta go down
to Fort Lauderdale,

449
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,269
to help my friend Lisa kill
this asshole named Bobby.

450
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,828
But if you want,
I can come pick you up.

451
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,443
Okay.

452
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:54,650
What if we drive by his house,
when he's in his yard or some shit?

453
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,685
Shoot him down.

454
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:59,221
Cops will think
it's a gang thing.

455
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,751
Shit, Lisa.
That a fuckin' great idea.

456
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,749
Donny:
Ow! Fuck, man!

457
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,081
Girl:
Thanks for getting me, Ali.

458
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,183
I stick
with my homies.

459
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,421
Is that joint
all you're holding?

460
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:42,689
We've got a glove box
full of acid.

461
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,398
Any tweak?

462
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,961
How was rehab?

463
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,911
Lisa: Just about raped Ali
last time she came.

464
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,390
He beats me.
He's raped me.

465
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,860
The worst part is the way
he picks on Marty.

466
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:16,490
He treats him like a dog
or a slave or something.

467
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,261
Pisses me off <i>so</i> bad
I can't stand it.

468
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,302
So, what are you
gonna do, Lisa?

469
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,269
I'm gonna kill him.

470
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:25,569
- That's some heavy shit.
- Yeah, it is!

471
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:28,303
Donny:
How are you gonna do it?

472
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,869
Why are you guys
<i>so</i> serious?

473
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,415
We're gonna fix
Bobby Kent's ass.

474
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,745
Claudia: Cool!

475
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,184
Holy shit!

476
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:40,586
Donny: Can we get
some napkins?

477
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,715
- Claudia: I'll be back.
- Donny: And a straw.

478
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,025
How are we gonna do it?

479
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,723
Lisa: I was thinking,
we could drive by his house,

480
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:51,790
when he's in his yard,
and shoot him down.

481
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,802
Lisa: The cops will think
it's a gang thing.

482
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,701
Oh, no.
Somebody will see us.

483
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,207
I know. We can go into his house
while he's sleeping,

484
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:00,799
and stab the fucker
in the neck.

485
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,607
- Donny: I brought my survival knife.
- He's got a doberman.

486
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,647
The best way
is just to shoot him.

487
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,206
- How do we get a gun?
- My ma has one.

488
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:19,826
Marty: We can't bonk him over
the head and drag him off somewhere.

489
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:20,862
<i>Girl: How come?</i>

490
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,455
He's too strong.

491
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,660
Wait a second.
Haven't you even met him before?

492
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,703
- Girl: No.
- Donny: No, me neither.

493
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:31,103
- Donny: What's this guy like?
- He's an asshole.

494
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:36,604
( Gun clicking )

495
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,341
Holy shit.
What he fuck is that for?

496
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:42,043
To kill Bobby Kent,
don't you remember?

497
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,052
Donny: Oh, yeah.

498
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,349
Hey, won't that
get blood everywhere?

499
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,686
Yeah, we're gonna have to plan
where we're gonna do it.

500
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:50,453
( Knocking on door )

501
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,820
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Mrs. Connelly.

502
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,463
These are my friends from Palm Bay.
This is Donny and this is Heather.

503
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:02,732
- Hi, Donny. Hi, Heather.
- Hey.

504
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,603
- Did you kids have supper?
- All: Yes ma'am.

505
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,403
Okay.

506
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:14,917
Are we really
gonna do this?

507
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,820
Jesus Christ, Ali, can you
get this guy to shut up?

508
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:19,877
Donny: Ow!

509
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:21,446
- Shut up, Donny.
- You shut up!

510
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,219
We'll have to find
a way to get him alone.

511
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,123
No shit,
he's gotta be by himself.

512
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:29,096
It's easier to kill someone
when they're by themselves.

513
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,928
Yeah.

514
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,468
Ali, what if you offer
to fuck him again?

515
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,801
Wait a minute, isn't this
the guy who raped you?

516
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,102
What do you mean...
like bait?

517
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,267
Yeah.

518
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,038
It's not enough
for him to go.

519
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:47,540
What if I offered
to let him dog out my 5.0?

520
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,381
- Donny: Excuse me--
- And then offer to fuck me again.

521
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,388
He can drive you out to the barrens
in Weston by the Glades.

522
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,048
Wait a second...
Okay?

523
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,592
If Ali's supposed
to be banging Bobby,

524
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,286
then what the fuck
is Donny doing here?

525
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,820
Marty: Seriously, the guy's
just gonna go and kick it,

526
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,833
while somebody else
screws his chick?

527
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,425
Marty: Nobody's
that big of a dweeb.

528
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,869
- ( Girls giggling )
- He's right.

529
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,911
Holy shit, I could--

530
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,412
We could say that
I'm Heather's boyfriend.

531
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:19,743
<i>You know'?</i>

532
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:23,674
Donny:
That's good, right?

533
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,725
- Marty: Hey?
- Hey.

534
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:34,160
- Marty: What're you doing?
- Homework.

535
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,356
Marty: No shit.

536
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,799
Well, I'm over
at Lisa's house,

537
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:43,202
and that Ali chick
is down here.

538
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,003
- I think she wants you.
- Bobby: What are you taking about?

539
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:49,439
<i>Hold on.</i>

540
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,005
Hey Bob,
what's going on?

541
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,014
Bobby: Hey!

542
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:56,743
Bobby:
You're not pissed off?

543
00:42:56,807 --> 00:43:00,380
No, I liked it, actually.
I've been thinking about it.

544
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:01,889
Maybe we could get
together.

545
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:05,359
We could take my 5.0 out
and get ballistic or something.

546
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,295
(Ali moaning )

547
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,662
Marty: What's up?

548
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,828
Bobby: Marty,
what's with this shit?

549
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,838
I don't know.
I guess she digs you.

550
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:20,307
You got me jealous over here.
She's fuckin' fine.

551
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,414
Hey, you're there
with fuckface?

552
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,878
- Marty: Yeah.
- Bobby: Oh. Sick.

553
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:35,717
Okay, we do it and just roll
the body into the canal.

554
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,486
That's out
by the Glades.

555
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,528
The gators will eat
his ass for lunch.

556
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:40,527
Here.

557
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,292
What are you
giving me that for?

558
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,061
You're in the best
position to do it.

559
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,102
You fuck him, then right
when he's gonna come,

560
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:49,194
- you blow his brains out.
- Oh, shit.

561
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:52,240
- Heather: That's cool.
- You're the one that wants him dead.

562
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,207
You want him dead too.

563
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:56,039
It's too risky
if I do it.

564
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,273
I'd have to follow him.
He might hear me coming.

565
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,539
Here, take it.

566
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:04,142
I'll be close by.

567
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:05,915
You shoot him,
we'll ditch the body.

568
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:09,484
All right, fuck it.
Let's go!

569
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:33,308
Hey, Bobby.
I'm Heather's girl--

570
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,747
boyfriend“ Fuck!

571
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:38,685
Hey Don--
uh, Bobby--

572
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:42,417
I'm Donny, this is Heather--
I'm-- I'm her boyfriend.

573
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:43,457
Yeah.

574
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,584
- That's good?
- Yeah.

575
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:46,423
I was thinking
we'd go out to Weston

576
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:48,190
and mess around
in those new developments

577
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,095
and dog out
my 5.0 or some shit.

578
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:52,225
I'll give these two
a ride back.

579
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:55,861
Wait a second,
you're not coming?

580
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:59,271
No, man.
I'm fucking worked.

581
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:01,070
What about her?

582
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:04,078
- I'm coming with you.
- Bobby: No, man!

583
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:06,774
I don't want your bitch
coming along with us.

584
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:09,113
Ali: Come on, Bobby.
She's my homie.

585
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,779
I haven't seen her
in a long time and...

586
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,550
we need to talk about some shit
on the way out anyway.

587
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:17,518
What?

588
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:19,254
Hey, Bobby.

589
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:24,561
I'm Donny, this is Heather.
I'm fucking her.

590
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:29,100
Okay, whatever,
I'm driving.

591
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,877
Goodbye, asshole.

592
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:52,188
You don't want
to dog it out some more?

593
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:56,823
- I mean, it is a 5.0.
- This ain't a 5.0, bitch.

594
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:01,759
How about
I dog you out? Huh?

595
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:07,240
What the fuck did we come
all the way out here for, then?

596
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:11,673
Fuck!

597
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:17,150
How about you give me
a fucking blow job, now?

598
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,489
What are you fucking
bitches talking about?

599
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:25,318
I'm going for a walk.

600
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:28,463
( Nervous laughter)

601
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:31,557
Shit, you got a fuckin'
irritating laugh, bitch.

602
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:25,180
- TV host: ...Miss Tennessee.
- ( audience applauding )

603
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:35,389
- Heather: So, is he dead?
- Nope, Lisa chickened out.

604
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:36,396
Fuck I did.

605
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:40,902
Yo, Marty, check out Miss Texas.
She's <i>so</i> fuckin' hot!

606
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,364
- You couldn't do it?
- Lisa: No, I just thought of something.

607
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:49,036
On "Homicide" they can take
a bullet out of the body

608
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,578
and trace it back
to the murder weapon.

609
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:53,137
If I use my mom's gun,
they can find out I did it.

610
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,649
- So then toss it!
- Toss what?

611
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,243
The gun, into the ocean, and
then they can't trace the bullet.

612
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:01,380
I can't do that.
My ma'd kill me.

613
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,152
You're bullshit too,
bitch.

614
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,523
- I am not.
- Are so.

615
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:08,392
I think you're all
fuckin' bullshit.

616
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:18,238
You guys need
professional help.

617
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,171
( Heather giggling )
Shit.

618
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:34,751
Man:
What's this shit?

619
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:37,883
- I thought you were professionals.
- We are fuckin' professionals.

620
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:40,360
Why are you giving us shit
we can't use?

621
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,300
( Bike bell ringing )

622
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:03,510
- Who is it?
- Some girl named Ali.

623
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:05,075
Ali?

624
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:06,450
Hey, Ali.
What's up?

625
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,717
Sure as hell don't sound
like a sanctioned hit.

626
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:16,064
You can come over
to talk about it,

627
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,065
but nothing's set
in stone, all right?

628
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:20,630
All right, cool.

629
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:50,822
(phone ringing)

630
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:58,430
- Lisa: Hey, it's me.
- What do you want?

631
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,406
Derek, I need you
for something big.

632
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:03,707
- Derek: My truck's broken.
- Fuck your truck, I need you.

633
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:07,048
Then I need a ride.

634
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:11,951
( Rap music playing )
( honking )

635
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,888
Donny:
Come on, come on.

636
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,102
- Donny: You're in, dude?
- Heather: Let's go.

637
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,502
Hey, I'm Heather.

638
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,006
You wanna hit this?

639
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:49,084
So what do you do, man?
What's your thing?

640
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:50,523
What do you do?

641
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:54,027
- I do "Combat."
- Oh shit, "Combat"?

642
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:56,860
I fuckin' love combat.
I like to drop acid and play.

643
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:00,697
That's cool.

644
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:03,169
So. You got
a place to play at?

645
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:07,504
Yeah, DNA Comics.
Across the street from Lisa's house.

646
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:11,068
- Got any acid?
- Yeah I got some acid, bro'.

647
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:17,909
<i>Open...</i> aaah.

648
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:20,113
Here you go, man.

649
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,690
All right.
Take us to DNA, Heather.

650
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,669
- Blasted!
- Wasted!

651
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,366
Both: Busted!

652
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,137
I think these guys
have been experimenting

653
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,974
with some
controlled substances.

654
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,308
You aren't just
whistling dixie.

655
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:48,372
Come on, get the fuck
out of the way.

656
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,850
Boy: Big floppy
donkey dick bully.

657
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,581
Computerized voice:
Choose your fighter.

658
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:56,954
Fight to the death.

659
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:12,096
- You're Marty, right?
- Yeah.

660
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:13,664
I've watched you
surf North Beach.

661
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,004
No shit?

662
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,011
I like to rollerblade
down there a lot.

663
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,377
Look like you get a good
workout from rollerblading.

664
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:21,507
Thanks.

665
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:23,915
Bobby: Marty?

666
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,045
You gotta get
back to work.

667
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:27,588
I'll be there
in a minute, man.

668
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:31,791
I've never
rollerbladed before.

669
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:35,557
We'll go sometime.
I'll teach you.

670
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,325
Here, let me
give you my number.

671
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,425
Please do.

672
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,473
What about your chick
at home, man?

673
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,531
That fat bitch
with your baby?

674
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:50,506
I mean it's--

675
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:57,509
Well I guess
I should be going now. Bye.

676
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,821
I work right here.

677
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,260
This is my lunch break,
if you ever wanna come visit me.

678
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:10,990
What a cunt!

679
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,274
( Video game playing )

680
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:28,216
- Derek: Fatalize.
- Donny: Fatalize, fatalize.

681
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:34,121
Computerized voice:
Fatalize.

682
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:37,021
Boy #1: He's gonna hurl.
- Boy #2: Oh, shit.

683
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,253
I got it. I got it.

684
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:46,357
Fucking A, man.
You fucking fatalized the guy.

685
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:50,371
( Boys jeering and razzing )

686
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:53,169
What the fuck, man--
What the fuck does fatalize mean?

687
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,177
- Does it mean death?
- No dude, it's worse.

688
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,975
Way worse, because
you have to live, man.

689
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:01,982
You have to live and
you're like a fuckin' baby.

690
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,075
Fuck, man!

691
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:06,815
Shit!

692
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:11,792
- Let's go help my cousin.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

693
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:13,827
Shit!

694
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,837
Girls:
Ew! Gross, yuck!

695
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:30,138
Sorry.

696
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:33,278
What's up, guys?

697
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:36,043
Sorry.

698
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:39,849
Ali: Go away.
Go away right now.

699
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:44,248
Go away?
Give me a kiss.

700
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:46,055
No, eeww!

701
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:49,757
Jesus Christ, you guys
should have seen what Derek did.

702
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:53,028
He turned this guy
into a baby.

703
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:56,070
Close your mouth
when you eat, Jesus!

704
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,003
Donny: Is this like
a joke or something?

705
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,541
No, it isn't a joke.
I know this guy, he's in a gang.

706
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:01,667
A hitman?

707
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:03,608
Ali: No doubt.

708
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:26,427
( Honking )

709
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,438
- ( honking )
- Damn it!

710
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:42,513
( Honking )

711
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,584
I got it, Dad.

712
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:53,455
Shit! Lay off the horn.
You're blasting my whole neighborhood.

713
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,393
What's up, Ali?

714
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:57,397
Nothing.

715
00:55:57,454 --> 00:56:00,526
We need to know if you can
get those guns for us, man.

716
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,036
Hitman: You need
to give me a little time.

717
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:05,266
<i>Can' t just snap
your fingers and shit.</i>

718
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:09,435
- Guns are hard to come by.
- I can get you some money.

719
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:12,139
Hitman: Oh yeah? Whose piggy bank
are you gonna rob?

720
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:16,406
Come on, you know
you can trust us.

721
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,051
Why do it with a gun?

722
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:24,058
Lisa: lt just seemed
like the easy way to do it.

723
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:27,459
Hitman: You need to chill out
and plan this out a little better.

724
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:28,825
Lisa:
No, I wanna do it now.

725
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,990
God damn it, I want
the son of a bitch dead.

726
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,692
I want his sorry ass
dead tonight.

727
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:34,997
Do you understand me?

728
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:38,430
<i>Hitman:
All right, look...</i>

729
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:40,475
maybe I can help you,
but I don't know.

730
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:44,041
First you guys need
some weapons and shit.

731
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,376
You should think about
planning this out better.

732
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:50,418
Then, when you get all that done,
then you can come see me.

733
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:52,817
Hitman: I have a window
around the rear.

734
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:55,186
Just come by and
knock a little lightly.

735
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,815
I'll be there.

736
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,089
Donny: Like a signal, right?
Like in Tom Sawyer.

737
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,826
( Scattered laughter)

738
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:09,264
My normal suppliers, they won't
help out with this shit.

739
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:11,965
Maybe I'll just come and
supervise, I don't know.

740
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:14,133
But either way,
you got a weapons problem.

741
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:22,649
I swear to God, I can't wait
to stab that motherfucker.

742
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:25,618
Slit his throat and
bleed him like a pig.

743
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:27,518
I'm gonna slice
his guts open,

744
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:29,716
spill his intestines
out on the dirt,

745
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,349
beat him in the head
with a baseball bat

746
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:32,893
until
his eyeballs fall out.

747
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:38,130
If you won't do it, I'll do it.
I'll cut the fucker for you.

748
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:41,431
I'll do it. I'll fuckin'--
I'll kill-- I'll--

749
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:43,437
I'll do it
if you won't do it.

750
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:54,944
So weird.
This shit's so weird.

751
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,784
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey, Aunt Mo.

752
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:07,454
Mrs. Connelly: Still here, Ali?
Don't you have a baby to take care of?

753
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:10,828
- She's on her way back.
- She should get her stuff and go, then.

754
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,767
You guys don't work.

755
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,497
You don't go to school,
you don't do anything.

756
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,200
All you do is lay around
and drive your cars,

757
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:22,140
and eat us out
of house and home.

758
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:23,939
You know
how that makes me feel?

759
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:28,873
- Mad!
- ( chuckling )

760
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,756
The fuck are we
gonna do now, man?

761
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:39,293
Just calm the fuck down.

762
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:50,404
- Heather: Ow, my butt!
- Donny: Fuck, Ali. This sucks.

763
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,871
Ali:
Don't worry about it.

764
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:54,340
We'll park around the corner
until Lisa's mom leaves.

765
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,304
You're not
with Ali, are you?

766
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:04,610
- Not unless I lose some weight.
- You've always had common sense.

767
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:09,222
I'm glad to see you
hanging out with Lisa.

768
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:12,622
I'm surprised,
but glad.

769
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,228
You like her friends?

770
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,656
I don't know.

771
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:24,532
I mean, they get a little crazy,
sometimes, but...

772
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:27,734
I'm just hanging out.

773
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:28,673
Good.

774
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:33,409
You know, when we lived in the Bronx,
at least we had a family.

775
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,347
Family kept things
tight and safe.

776
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:42,288
Down here in Florida, nobody's tight.
Everybody's just... whatever.

777
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:46,525
Don't Ali's parents
wonder where she is?

778
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,562
I don't know.

779
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:53,195
I'm going over to your mother's,
play some cards.

780
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:04,239
Ali: What?

781
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,779
What's the matter?

782
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:09,908
Nothing, I love you, Ali.
I truly love you.

783
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:12,044
I do too, Ali.

784
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:19,254
We're gonna be okay,
guys, you know?

785
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:22,091
We're gonna get
this shit behind us and...

786
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:24,961
we're gonna be back
in time in Palm Bay,

787
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,627
for Denny's birthday
at his mom's house.

788
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:30,967
Shit, I never knew nobody
who killed somebody.

789
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:34,706
Me neither.

790
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:39,302
Heather: Just my grandpa.
I never knew him.

791
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:40,848
No way?

792
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:43,941
Yeah. My grandpa
was a bad drunk.

793
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:45,748
Really bad.

794
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:52,088
He'd rape anyone dumb enough
to walk by his room.

795
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:56,255
One night...
he got...

796
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,823
really pissed at my grandma and
he took a claw hammer to her face.

797
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:08,141
After that, he locked himself
up with her...

798
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:10,677
in his room
for two whole days...

799
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:15,807
and he kept drinking and having sex
with her after she was dead.

800
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,852
My mom was in the house
the whole time.

801
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:23,584
- Fuck.
- She was only 15.

802
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:30,322
Holy shit.

803
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:33,026
You know, it really
messed with her head.

804
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:39,062
After that, she only hung out with guys
who beat the hell out of her.

805
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,369
And then,
when I was little,

806
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,741
she'd get drunk and
she'd drag me and my brother

807
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,474
out of bed at four
in the morning and...

808
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:50,348
she had all the news clippings
about my grandpa...

809
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:54,286
and she'd read them
over and over again.

810
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:58,291
I knew every word
before kindergarten.

811
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,453
I think that's how
I learned to read.

812
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:08,502
She's gone.
We should go.

813
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:12,735
That chick Ali gave me
a blow job, last night.

814
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:17,005
- And I fucked her.
- Cool.

815
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,909
She called again.

816
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:21,141
Says you all are going
back out to Weston.

817
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:23,547
Marty?

818
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:26,086
Yeah man,
that's the plan.

819
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:27,382
Are you going out?

820
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:34,318
Hey, man?
You're my best friend.

821
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:36,362
Right?

822
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:38,465
Yeah.

823
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,412
Okay, we're picking
Marty up in 45 minutes.

824
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:03,150
Derek, what's up
with the baseball bat?

825
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:07,627
Lisa: Come on,
we need more weapons.

826
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:12,756
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

827
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:16,827
- My ma said something?
- No, it's just--

828
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:20,339
Never mind,
everything's okay.

829
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:30,550
My back hurts.
I have a tension backache.

830
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:33,143
Derek, will you
give me a massage?

831
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:42,161
Me too, my back hurts too.
I want a massage.

832
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,458
Ali: Harder.

833
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:45,897
- Derek: Like that?
- Ali: Hmmm!

834
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:54,737
Watch it!

835
01:03:58,134 --> 01:03:59,272
I guess I'll--

836
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:03,244
Okay, I guess I'll go
do something about the bats.

837
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:04,751
Good idea.

838
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:13,555
Okay, there's one thing
left to do.

839
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:17,223
- Ali: What's that?
- The hitman needs a ride.

840
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:27,874
Mr. Kent: Where are you
going tonight, Bob?

841
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:30,069
Going out
with my friend.

842
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:33,778
Need any money?

843
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:35,816
No Dad.
I'm cool, thanks.

844
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:55,928
Marty, could I use
your bathroom?

845
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:57,630
- Number one or two?
- Derek: One.

846
01:04:57,693 --> 01:04:59,138
Just go in the alley.

847
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,206
- What's up, man?
- <i>How's</i> it going?

848
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:07,840
CMF, CMF, what the fuck?
What does that mean, CMF?

849
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,815
Lisa: Didn't we already
tell him what it means?

850
01:05:09,872 --> 01:05:11,146
What's with this guy?

851
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:13,551
- What does it mean?
- It means Crazy MotherFucker.

852
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:15,350
It's like
"The Godfather"...

853
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,550
- A division of the Davy Boyz.
- Oh, shit!

854
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:21,493
Fuckin' Godfather,
Crazy MotherFuckers. Holy shit!

855
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,120
Crazy MotherFuckers, huh?

856
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:24,858
- Donny: Holy shit!
- Hey, man?

857
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,424
- Think this is heavy enough?
- To kill a guy?

858
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,369
- Yeah.
- Maybe, if you hit him right.

859
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:31,837
You mean in the back
of the head or some shit?

860
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:34,431
It don't matter. You just gotta
hit him hard enough.

861
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:36,101
Yeah,
I guess that's the key.

862
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:37,200
Yeah.

863
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:40,475
You can't just smack the motherfucker,
you've got to really wack him!

864
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:42,379
It's not like in a fight
and you're mad at him.

865
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:45,851
You're not trying to hurt him.
You're trying to kill him.

866
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:48,149
Marty:
I got something else.

867
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:51,253
See, that's cool!

868
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:52,622
Hitman:
It's Marty, right?

869
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:54,127
- Donny: Yo!
- Marty: Yeah.

870
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:57,164
Donny: What about this shit?
This shit is good enough?

871
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,926
Right here, right here.

872
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:03,134
Hitman: What the fuck for?
You're gonna play baseball?

873
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:05,900
- No!
- Then why the fuck you got a bat?

874
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,635
What are you
gonna do with that?

875
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:09,836
- For the guy!
- What guy?

876
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:10,877
Bobby Kent!

877
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:13,004
- What about Bobby Kent?
- The guy we're going to kill!

878
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:16,676
Is this bat good enough
to ram his fuckin' head in?

879
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:18,741
- Hitman: I don't know, man.
- How about this knife?

880
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,186
This knife is good, right?
I tried to sharpen it but--

881
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:24,816
- Hitman: I don't know, man!
- All right, fuck!

882
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,451
Are we going
just to fight this guy,

883
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:29,086
or are we gonna
kill him?

884
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:31,631
I want him dead tonight and
I don't want any bullshit!

885
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:37,694
Yeah, I mean, this is
the son of a bitch that raped Ali.

886
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,297
- He fuckin' raped her!
- Yeah, just think about it.

887
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:42,309
He won't even
let Marty have a life.

888
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:45,039
He beats him every time he does
something Bobby doesn't like.

889
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:45,977
Do you fuckin' mind?

890
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:48,140
He won't even let him
see his own family.

891
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:50,917
That sucks.

892
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,154
This guy
deserves to die.

893
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:57,020
He does deserve it.
Agreed.

894
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:58,820
So we're not just
gonna scare him.

895
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:01,157
- We're gonna kill him?
- Donny: We're gonna kill him!

896
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:04,564
I want this motherfucker dead,
you understand me?

897
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,692
( Snapping fingers)
I want this motherfucker dead.

898
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:11,933
Donny: ♪ Let's fuckin' kill him,
fuckin' kill him! ♪

899
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:14,998
Donny: Dead!
Let's kill the motherfucker.

900
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:17,977
- All: Dead! Dead! Dead!
- Dead.

901
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,139
Dead! We're gonna
kill this fucker.

902
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,704
All: Dead! Dead!
Dead! Dead--

903
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:24,684
Oh, shit, sorry. Go ahead.
I'm gonna fuckin' lose it.

904
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:25,684
Go ahead.

905
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:30,614
You people need to understand
some shit here.

906
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:31,749
What?

907
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:33,088
This isn't a game.

908
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:34,890
We're not a bunch of kids
playing make believe.

909
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:37,556
- Who says we're playing?
- Come down, all right?

910
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,998
You guys got to understand
that me and my people,

911
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,501
we're what you call
serious people.

912
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:43,594
And you do know what
I mean when I say serious.

913
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,696
- We understand what you--
- What does it mean?

914
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:48,264
- Enlighten me.
- It means you ain't playing.

915
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,810
I said from the beginning
that I'd kill this dude.

916
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,573
I was the first one
to say it.

917
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:55,138
So don't fuckin' treat me
like I'm a kid, okay?

918
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:57,275
What about you?

919
01:07:57,339 --> 01:08:00,479
This guy? Dude, this fuckin'
kid is cold, man.

920
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:03,319
I've been hangin' out with him
for only a couple days,

921
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:06,883
I've seen this guy do shit
you wouldn't believe.

922
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:09,492
He's cold.

923
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:11,327
All right, that's good.

924
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,628
- Yeah, that's real good.
- ( door opening )

925
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:15,998
- Hi, Mom!
- Hey, Loverbug.

926
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:17,435
Mother: What are you kids
doing tonight?

927
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:19,234
Marty: Probably going
to the movies.

928
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:21,502
- Mother: Drive safe, okay?
- Marty: I will.

929
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:24,640
Mother: Be careful
with my car, honey.

930
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,043
Okay, Mom.

931
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:49,001
What's going on, man?

932
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:51,664
You tell me, dude.
Who are these fuckin' assholes?

933
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:54,503
Just some fuckin' dudes
Ali brought down from Palm Bay.

934
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:57,305
Some dudes.
What the fuck, man?

935
01:08:57,366 --> 01:09:00,108
I thought you said
she wanted to fuck me.

936
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:01,876
She does, dude.
That's the fuck she wants.

937
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:03,245
That's all she's been
talking about.

938
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,943
We're just gonna
dog out the rides.

939
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:07,146
See if the Mustang
can take my old lady's ride.

940
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,654
That's fuckin' stupid.

941
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:13,125
What kind of race
is that, man?

942
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:15,856
Why don't you chill, Bobby?
Goddamn, dude.

943
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:19,297
We'll go out to the dunes
where you guys were last time.

944
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:21,335
You didn't do
<i>so</i> bad then, did you?

945
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:22,334
Huh?

946
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:24,967
All right, man.

947
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:37,750
Get in the back, bitch.
I'm driving this piece of shit.

948
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:44,147
Damn.
Keep you in mind.

949
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:50,889
Show me how
to shift this thing.

950
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:57,698
- Ali: You're <i>so</i> hot!
- I'm not hot, baby, I'm just big.

951
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,001
(tires screeching )

952
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:04,066
Hitman: That guy's an asshole
to be driving like that.

953
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:06,841
Lisa: Tell me about it.
We've got to kill that fucker.

954
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:12,313
- All right, I love these dudes.
- I love them too, man.

955
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:15,082
They're <i>so</i> good. Did you see them
when they were down here?

956
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:17,021
Fuck yeah, man.
You?

957
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:22,419
I went down to the show with my friend
and we got <i>so</i> fucked up.

958
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:25,021
So did the whole fuckin'
crowd, man.

959
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:28,796
They had this fat Chinese guy
on stage with them--

960
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:30,495
Buddha dude! Buddha dude!

961
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:33,301
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah.
- He was a fuckin' Buddha dude!

962
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:38,072
He had this huge marijuana leaf
on his stomach, you know?

963
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:41,273
Yeah, man. Then they played
this one song...

964
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:44,011
and the whole fuckin' <i>crowd</i>
lit up at once.

965
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,986
Marijuana, just fuckin'
smoking, everybody.

966
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:48,680
I lit up too.

967
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:52,456
- Right on.
- Ali: We might as well get high.

968
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:58,555
What did that dude
mean earlier when he said

969
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:00,862
he had seen you
do some amazing shit?

970
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:04,598
Me? I don't know what
that dude thinks he saw me do.

971
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:07,732
- Derek: Could be anything.
- Hitman: Yeah but what exactly?

972
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:10,208
Did you do somebody
or something?

973
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,746
I kind of got down
on a guy earlier today.

974
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,109
You killed him?

975
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:17,048
No, it wasn't anything like that.
It was at the mall.

976
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:20,846
I put a little
disciplinary action on him.

977
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:23,521
Disciplinary action.

978
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:25,615
I like that.

979
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:27,854
You put some
disciplinary action on him.

980
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,088
Yeah.

981
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,396
What's your deal, man?
Huh?

982
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:41,635
- Donny: What?
- Why are you here?

983
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:49,647
<i>I am...</i>

984
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:54,383
He's Heather's boyfriend.
He's here with her.

985
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:56,081
Yeah.

986
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:02,893
- You live in Palm Bay?
- Yep.

987
01:12:04,453 --> 01:12:06,262
So why--
I mean what's your--

988
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,166
What's your deal?
Why did you come down?

989
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:12,202
<i>L...</i>

990
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:15,433
I don't know.

991
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:19,804
Ali: To see what a fine
looking man I'm going out with.

992
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:21,677
- Yeah.
- ( girls giggling )

993
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:27,015
- You call that going out?
- I don't know.

994
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:30,918
I call it
a fuckin' blow job.

995
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:35,253
Damn fine blow job,
but a blow job all the same.

996
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:39,527
What do you mean by going out?
What the hell's your definition?

997
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:42,660
I don't fuckin' know.
What's your name again, Feather?

998
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:45,865
My name's not Feather,
it's Heather.

999
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:49,407
All right. Let me ask you
a question, Heather.

1000
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:51,911
Are you a hooker here,
like your friend?

1001
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,605
- Donny: Oh, shit.
- Shit.

1002
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:58,510
Bobby: Huh?

1003
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:03,023
You know what?
You better watch your mouth...

1004
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:06,616
or my boyfriend
will be real pissed at you.

1005
01:13:08,117 --> 01:13:10,597
Who's that?
Lonny back there?

1006
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:13,326
You're talking about Lonny
in the back seat?

1007
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,426
He's gonna get mad
at me and then what?

1008
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:18,370
What's he gonna do then?
What are you gonna do, Lonny?

1009
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,101
It's Donny, dude.

1010
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:25,543
It's definitely Donny.

1011
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:28,013
Yeah, whatever. You know
your girlfriend's a hooker?

1012
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:30,115
For real.

1013
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:34,484
That teen prostitution bust,
two years back?

1014
01:13:34,543 --> 01:13:37,717
They were 14,
they got busted.

1015
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:39,817
That was these two holes
turning tricks

1016
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:42,055
for crusty old men
at $100 a pop.

1017
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:44,760
For real.

1018
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:48,358
Marty tells me you guys have turned
a few tricks yourselves.

1019
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:52,365
What?

1020
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:56,403
Is that what Marty Puccio
said about me?

1021
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:06,482
So? We're gonna beat
the shit out of this guy or what?

1022
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:12,186
I don't know, bro'.
They say they want to kill him.

1023
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:22,364
- How do think it's gonna go down?
- Hitman: You're talking to me?

1024
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:25,132
Yeah, we got what?
You, me, Donny and Derek.

1025
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:26,537
Wait, who's Donny?

1026
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:28,632
Ali's boyfriend
from Palm Bay.

1027
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:31,268
Geez! That guy's
fuckin' retarded.

1028
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:34,246
Lisa: No, he just gets high a lot.
He's as normal as you and me.

1029
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,249
Shit, that may not be
saying too much.

1030
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:40,210
We brought you here 'cause
you're supposed to be the gangster,

1031
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:42,755
- and the hitman and all that.
- Yeah.

1032
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,813
- Well?
- Well?

1033
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,382
So, what do we do?

1034
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:48,894
We're gonna need a plan,
like a signal.

1035
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:51,329
The fuck you mean,
like a signal?

1036
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:54,560
You get the guy out here
telling you're gonna race cars,

1037
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:56,432
but the real reason
he's here is for the bitch.

1038
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:59,302
- The bitch?
- He thinks he's gonna fuck Ali.

1039
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:02,570
We need to get Ali
to lead him off somewhere,

1040
01:15:02,631 --> 01:15:04,167
and then we'll
sneak up from behind.

1041
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:06,770
- Then we give the signal.
- And then what?

1042
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:08,143
Then we kill him.

1043
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:12,242
- So, what's the signal?
- I don't know.

1044
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:15,481
We'll have to wait 'til I get there,
<i>so</i> I can check out the scene.

1045
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:17,182
This has
to be done right.

1046
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,099
Let's take a walk.

1047
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:29,234
<i>Let's do it.</i>

1048
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:52,549
Marty: He's gonna tell us
what to do.

1049
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:55,458
Yeah,
I got a few ideas.

1050
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:58,430
I can't believe we're doing this.
My adrenaline's--

1051
01:15:58,487 --> 01:15:59,932
Shut the fuck up,
Donny!

1052
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:01,865
Heather: You shouldn't
yell like that.

1053
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:04,871
It's not like someone's
gonna hear us out here.

1054
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:06,770
You know what?
You shouldn't yell...

1055
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:10,241
because someone could hear and
think someone's getting killed--

1056
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:12,074
I'll keep that
in mind, Heather.

1057
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:13,841
Hitman:
Who else has a weapon?

1058
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:18,449
You still got that knife?

1059
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:19,952
- Yeah.
- So get it out!

1060
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:23,556
Do you plan
on doing anything?

1061
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:25,956
Fuckin' right.

1062
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:30,196
So what?
What do you want us to do?

1063
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,198
I don't know.
What do you wanna do?

1064
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:35,599
- I want this fucker dead now.
- I understand that.

1065
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:38,194
Here's what I think
we should do.

1066
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,264
We're gonna need a signal,
<i>so</i> Heather...

1067
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:43,867
you walk down there like
you're gonna talk to them.

1068
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:47,141
When you see that everything's okay,
that he doesn't suspect shit...

1069
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:50,445
then you yell out "Are there
any alligators down there?"

1070
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:52,712
When we hear that,
we'll know it's time.

1071
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:59,090
- Alligators in where?
- In the canal.

1072
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:00,319
It's a signal.

1073
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:03,887
Just say something about alligators,
all right? Then we'll do him.

1074
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:07,365
I say "alligators"
and then you'll come.

1075
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:09,231
Yeah,
it's a signal.

1076
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:10,861
- You.
- Yeah.

1077
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:13,429
Go down there like you're her boyfriend,
hold your hand or some shit.

1078
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:15,668
When you hear
that signal, do it!

1079
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:17,438
- Okay.
- So, go!

1080
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:18,705
All right!

1081
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:23,014
- What do you want me to do?
- You back 'em up.

1082
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:27,953
Donny: Go!

1083
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:30,923
We'll back them from up here,
<i>so</i> he can't get away.

1084
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,200
Uh, yeah...

1085
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:49,868
Are there
any alligators in there?

1086
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:52,137
What?

1087
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,010
Ali: She asked if
there were any alligators.

1088
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:58,608
I don't know. Why don't you go
skinny-dip to find out?

1089
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,952
Heather: I asked him if there were
any alligators in there.

1090
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:05,789
( Roar)

1091
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:10,459
Motherfucker!

1092
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:14,730
God damn it!

1093
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:17,396
Marty!

1094
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:21,601
( Sobbing )

1095
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:22,903
Marty!

1096
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:32,311
( Heather screaming )

1097
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:35,449
Please Marty, please!

1098
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:38,150
Please, whatever I did,
I'm sorry!

1099
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:39,419
Derek: Just go!

1100
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:44,987
( Weeping )

1101
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:56,370
Hitman:
He can't get away!

1102
01:18:57,432 --> 01:18:58,570
Hitman: Get him!

1103
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:03,277
( Choking )

1104
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:16,994
Hitman: Finish him!
Go, go!

1105
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:32,069
Turn your goddamn
lights off, Ali!

1106
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:43,522
- What do you want?
- Get out.

1107
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:46,318
Get fuckin' out!

1108
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:49,323
Help me carry him.

1109
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:52,257
Hitman:
Why are you standing around

1110
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,993
instead of doing
what I tell you to do!?

1111
01:19:55,757 --> 01:19:58,033
- Is he dead?
- Shut up, Heather.

1112
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:00,004
- Hitman: Help me pick him up.
- Why?

1113
01:20:00,061 --> 01:20:02,268
Because we gotta get him
out of sight, asshole!

1114
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:05,038
- Is he dead?
- The fucker's definitely dead.

1115
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,706
They just beat his head in
with a baseball bat.

1116
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:11,342
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I don't wanna get blood on my shirt.

1117
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:13,682
We're not gonna
hug him, asshole!

1118
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:17,086
Grab his feet,
I'll grab his arms.

1119
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:22,320
What do you wanna do
with him?

1120
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,295
Throw him in the canal.
The gators will get him.

1121
01:20:24,352 --> 01:20:27,128
By the time anyone gets here,
there'll be nothing left to find.

1122
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:28,429
Donny: Cool.

1123
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:30,693
Lift!

1124
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:35,206
- Can we go?
- Just shut up!

1125
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:38,802
- Now what, asshole?
- What?

1126
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:40,540
This is not too good.

1127
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:45,376
Derek:
Why isn't he dead?

1128
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:49,786
Just throw him in the water, man.
This kid isn't gonna swim.

1129
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:58,428
Is he dead yet?

1130
01:20:59,654 --> 01:21:00,689
Getting there.

1131
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:11,910
Take me home now.

1132
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:15,309
Where's everybody going?

1133
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,043
Where do you think
we're going, Disneyland?

1134
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:19,176
- We're going home!
- Bullshit!

1135
01:21:19,241 --> 01:21:22,347
Let me tell you.
We better get our alibis straight.

1136
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:25,721
- I ain't having this pinned on me!
- Right, but we gotta leave

1137
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:26,986
before someone finds us.

1138
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:29,050
We'll go to the mall
near my house

1139
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:31,393
and chill out there and
get our stories straight.

1140
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:36,060
Marty, you're okay?

1141
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,252
That shit didn't go down right.
People weren't cool!

1142
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:05,662
We can't go to the mall.

1143
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:08,132
There's too many kids
hanging out there.

1144
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:09,964
How about North Beach?

1145
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:12,266
We chill out and get our shit
together about the alibi.

1146
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:13,601
You better tell them.

1147
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:19,510
North Beach.

1148
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:33,384
You shouldn't
feel bad, Ali.

1149
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:36,120
He deserved to die.

1150
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:40,429
He would have hurt you,
or your baby.

1151
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:43,534
What do you mean?

1152
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:47,731
I don't know.
I don't know, I--

1153
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:54,212
I just don't think you should have
a guilt trip or something.

1154
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:55,213
No?

1155
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:07,785
Lisa:
It smells like blood.

1156
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:09,829
What? You're crazy.
I don't smell anything.

1157
01:23:09,884 --> 01:23:11,659
It smells like blood.
You can smell it.

1158
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,700
Ali:
I don't smell it.

1159
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:16,736
Lisa says she smells blood,
then she smells blood.

1160
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:17,861
People are different.

1161
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:20,497
It fucking stinks.

1162
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:22,508
Ali: What does blood
smell like, anyway?

1163
01:23:24,299 --> 01:23:28,372
I don't know.
But it reeks!

1164
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:29,471
Lisa?

1165
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:33,213
What is it, baby?

1166
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:37,045
I forgot the sheath
to my diving knife.

1167
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:39,558
No, you put it behind the bushes,
I saw you.

1168
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:40,615
Yeah.

1169
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:44,928
- You didn't get it?
- No.

1170
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:49,968
- I can't go back.
- You have to.

1171
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:52,403
Marty, they can find
the fingerprints.

1172
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,963
But there can be
people there by now.

1173
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,737
Jesus fuckin' Christ,
what now?

1174
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:59,972
I got to go back.
I left my sheath back there.

1175
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,708
We're gonna have
to go back anyway.

1176
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:03,078
We didn't cover
the tire tracks,

1177
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:04,674
people might have left
other shit out there.

1178
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:06,582
We just freaked!
We left too fast.

1179
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:10,953
- I can't go back there.
- We're not asking you.

1180
01:24:11,012 --> 01:24:11,990
Ali?

1181
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,033
You were his best friend.
You'll be the number one suspect.

1182
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:25,902
That doesn't make sense.
I should be the last they suspect.

1183
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:29,430
You're not a cop!
You don't know how they think.

1184
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:33,502
They suspect you even if you look
like the most innocent person.

1185
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:38,039
The more innocent you seem, the more
they get off on fucking with you.

1186
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:39,585
They get off on that shit.

1187
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:44,345
Hitman: We're here.

1188
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:48,786
- Ali: Do you think there's--
- Shhh!

1189
01:24:54,722 --> 01:24:55,700
Ready?

1190
01:24:57,459 --> 01:24:58,870
Let's make
this shit fast.

1191
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:03,171
Police planes stealth around here,
looking for raves and vandals.

1192
01:25:09,804 --> 01:25:12,614
- ( Door slamming )
- Sorry.

1193
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:28,189
Jesus, man!
Don't do that.

1194
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:30,395
- Any luck?
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

1195
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:32,062
We need to see
if he's still there.

1196
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:36,200
- What the fuck are you--
- No man, we're here right now!

1197
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:38,141
We need to see
if anybody's found him yet.

1198
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:44,876
Over here!

1199
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:54,384
- Marty: Fuck is that?
- Crabs. They're eating him.

1200
01:25:56,584 --> 01:26:01,055
- ( Retching )
- That's fuckin' sick. That's gross.

1201
01:26:02,123 --> 01:26:03,761
Nature sucks.

1202
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:12,371
There is blood
on my shoe.

1203
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:14,037
There's blood
on my fuckin' shoe!

1204
01:26:15,403 --> 01:26:18,384
Some dog is gonna come down
and dig this stuff up.

1205
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:20,385
People do that.
They bring their dogs here.

1206
01:26:20,441 --> 01:26:23,081
Even though it's illegal.
The lifeguards don't do shit.

1207
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:25,283
If someone finds this stuff.

1208
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:27,348
- If someone finds this stuff--
- Chill, Lisa.

1209
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:30,563
You didn't do anything.

1210
01:26:30,618 --> 01:26:33,929
I was there, you didn't do
anything. Neither did I.

1211
01:26:33,988 --> 01:26:35,023
Okay?

1212
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:37,325
I definitely didn't.

1213
01:26:37,392 --> 01:26:39,895
- ( Shearing )
- What?

1214
01:26:39,961 --> 01:26:42,032
I didn't kill anybody.
I just went along for the ride.

1215
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:45,441
- You fuckin' drowned the guy!
- I only helped carry the body

1216
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,810
'cause that Mafia guy
was gonna beat me.

1217
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:50,076
- I didn't do shit.
- Neither did I.

1218
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:52,482
- You stabbed him first!
- Fuck you!

1219
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:56,716
- The blade went in like that much.
- What about the other 10 times?

1220
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:01,618
God damn it, Lisa!
Give me the bat back.

1221
01:27:01,683 --> 01:27:03,663
I got to return it
or I gotta pay for it.

1222
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:32,016
Where are the knives?

1223
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:37,121
- I threw them in the ocean.
- You threw them where in the ocean?

1224
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:39,631
The bitch's been going postal
ever since you left.

1225
01:27:39,687 --> 01:27:40,961
She's crazy, thinks
she's gonna get caught.

1226
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:42,660
No,
I didn't do shit!

1227
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:44,499
If anyone gets caught,
it'll be you.

1228
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:45,867
You stabbed him first.

1229
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,338
Shut up!
I didn't do shit.

1230
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:50,069
So we've been talking about
getting caught, and who did what.

1231
01:27:50,131 --> 01:27:52,771
That's a great talk to have.
We need to have that talk.

1232
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:54,507
So, what have you
decided?

1233
01:28:00,975 --> 01:28:03,046
You, doper?
What do you think?

1234
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:05,057
Did you kill
that motherfucker?

1235
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:06,091
<i>No.</i>

1236
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:09,458
I mean, I stabbed the dude.
I admit that.

1237
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:12,054
Everyone saw me do that.
But I didn't--

1238
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,929
I didn't actually
kill him.

1239
01:28:13,988 --> 01:28:16,332
He was still alive after
I finished sticking him.

1240
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:17,802
You saw the fucker run.

1241
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:18,929
And you?

1242
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:22,204
You know
I didn't kill him.

1243
01:28:22,263 --> 01:28:24,470
Who helped me drown
the son of bitch, then?

1244
01:28:24,532 --> 01:28:27,206
- He was dead already.
- Hitman: Oh, he was dead?

1245
01:28:27,268 --> 01:28:29,475
He was <i>so</i> far
fuckin' gone, man.

1246
01:28:30,538 --> 01:28:32,540
I just picked him up
to help you move him.

1247
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:36,350
I didn't--
I didn't kill anybody.

1248
01:28:37,912 --> 01:28:38,856
Ladies?

1249
01:28:40,882 --> 01:28:43,021
Of course not!
You had nothing to do with it,

1250
01:28:43,084 --> 01:28:44,927
you were just
our dates, correct?

1251
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,861
<i>Me and Mr. Marty
have spoken...</i>

1252
01:28:47,922 --> 01:28:50,459
on the way to retrieving the sheath
that was left at the scene.

1253
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:53,438
The murder scene. You understand
that we murdered somebody?

1254
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:54,996
We took
your friend's life!

1255
01:28:55,063 --> 01:28:56,736
I wanna make sure
we're on the same page.

1256
01:28:58,866 --> 01:29:00,470
I know you fuckin'
smokeheads.

1257
01:29:00,535 --> 01:29:02,071
You're having
your thrills and shit.

1258
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:03,774
This is no fucking
video game.

1259
01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:06,011
Your friend you were
<i>so</i> very pissed at,

1260
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:07,610
he's lying face down
in the swamp,

1261
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:10,451
with his eyes hanging out
and the crabs eating him.

1262
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:12,513
I don't intend on going down
for this shit.

1263
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:16,551
If any of you take me down,
I will kill his ass, or her ass.

1264
01:29:16,617 --> 01:29:19,393
We're gonna sit on
this beach, right now,

1265
01:29:19,454 --> 01:29:22,594
and work out this alibi
until I'm satisfied with it.

1266
01:29:22,657 --> 01:29:23,897
You've reached the Kents.

1267
01:29:23,958 --> 01:29:25,835
Please leave your name
and number at the beep.

1268
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:27,634
We'll get back to you
as soon as we can.

1269
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:28,799
Have a good day.

1270
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:31,469
Bobby,
this is Marty Puccio.

1271
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,273
I called you.

1272
01:29:34,335 --> 01:29:38,112
You asked me to call
when I got home, <i>so</i> I'm calling.

1273
01:29:38,172 --> 01:29:39,207
Mr. Kent: Marty?

1274
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:02,035
You think they could say
I was guilty of it?

1275
01:30:02,096 --> 01:30:03,507
I guess.

1276
01:30:06,134 --> 01:30:07,943
You stabbed him
in the heart.

1277
01:30:08,002 --> 01:30:10,915
When you were on top of him
and he was on his back.

1278
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:15,280
No shit! I had that Mafia guy
with a baseball bat

1279
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:17,448
telling me
what to do every minute.

1280
01:30:17,512 --> 01:30:19,185
Yeah, that's true.

1281
01:30:20,515 --> 01:30:23,086
I guess they'd say
he did it.

1282
01:30:24,185 --> 01:30:27,598
No shit, Lisa! The guy bashed
his brains out with a ball bat.

1283
01:30:30,057 --> 01:30:31,127
Lisa: Oh shit!

1284
01:30:32,627 --> 01:30:35,631
That was <i>so</i> gross!
( nervous laughter)

1285
01:30:35,696 --> 01:30:39,234
And the guy goes like--
and the shit just--

1286
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:40,973
<i>That was so sick!</i>

1287
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:48,584
You don't think
I could get in trouble?

1288
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:51,319
For what?

1289
01:30:53,614 --> 01:30:55,821
For being there,
like an accessory?

1290
01:30:58,252 --> 01:31:01,665
They could say that you were
a witness, but that's about it.

1291
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:03,497
That's no big deal.

1292
01:31:08,696 --> 01:31:10,539
So,
how do you feel?

1293
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:14,473
- If we don't get caught?
- Yeah.

1294
01:31:14,535 --> 01:31:19,348
Shit, babe! I feel like
a ton of bricks got lifted off me.

1295
01:31:22,343 --> 01:31:23,515
We did it.

1296
01:31:26,714 --> 01:31:28,921
We killed a guy.

1297
01:31:32,053 --> 01:31:33,498
( Giggling )

1298
01:32:00,882 --> 01:32:03,021
Hey man, I heard.
You're off the chain!

1299
01:32:03,084 --> 01:32:04,757
- What?
- You're out of hand.

1300
01:32:04,819 --> 01:32:05,957
The fuck
you're talking about?

1301
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:08,091
Fatalize, man.
Fatalize.

1302
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:15,033
I don't know, man.
I'm just <i>so</i> uptight.

1303
01:32:15,096 --> 01:32:17,599
I can't sleep or do shit...
It's like--

1304
01:32:18,766 --> 01:32:22,236
I'm worried they're gonna find
some shit that's gonna give us away.

1305
01:32:22,303 --> 01:32:24,340
I'm gonna...
get caught.

1306
01:32:25,506 --> 01:32:28,282
I'm <i>so</i> fucked!
I just--

1307
01:32:28,342 --> 01:32:29,685
I just can't stop
thinking about it.

1308
01:32:31,012 --> 01:32:32,719
You didn't kill
that dude, did you?

1309
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:34,919
No! Hell no! I didn't have
shit to do with it.

1310
01:32:34,982 --> 01:32:36,325
But I was there.

1311
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:38,591
Someone could say
I was a witness.

1312
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:42,726
I don't know. Maybe if you just know
that something like this happened,

1313
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:44,963
and you don't tell the cops,
they have some fuckin' law,

1314
01:32:45,026 --> 01:32:47,165
some fine print that
could get you in trouble.

1315
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:52,109
Like leaving the scene
of an accident and not reporting it.

1316
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:54,009
Yeah, they have that
in driver's ed.

1317
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:56,981
I know.
So, shit!

1318
01:32:57,972 --> 01:33:00,248
It's like“ I just--

1319
01:33:00,308 --> 01:33:01,582
I need an alibi, man.

1320
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:05,489
I need someone to say
I was with him, so--

1321
01:33:05,546 --> 01:33:07,321
so, I could be like,

1322
01:33:07,381 --> 01:33:09,691
"No... I wasn't anywhere near
those assholes that night.

1323
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:11,423
I was nowhere near them."

1324
01:33:11,485 --> 01:33:13,260
Say this to who?

1325
01:33:13,321 --> 01:33:15,028
To the cops.

1326
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:20,102
I need someone to say
I was with them.

1327
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:29,338
What kind of asshole is gonna lie
to the cops about a murder?

1328
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,289
Hey Lisa.
What's up?

1329
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:45,294
You're not gonna believe this shit.
You're not gonna believe it.

1330
01:33:45,353 --> 01:33:46,661
We killed Bobby.

1331
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:47,927
Claudia: Pardon me?

1332
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:50,897
We killed him, he's dead.
We did it.

1333
01:33:52,026 --> 01:33:55,371
You should've seen it.
Marty stuck him right in the heart.

1334
01:33:55,429 --> 01:33:57,409
Lisa, what are you
talking about?

1335
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:00,503
No shit, listen.

1336
01:34:00,568 --> 01:34:02,707
You know that guy Donny?

1337
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:04,681
You know, the loser?
You met him.

1338
01:34:07,274 --> 01:34:10,653
He stuck him right
in the back of the head.

1339
01:34:10,711 --> 01:34:12,588
Claudia: Lisa, what?

1340
01:34:13,681 --> 01:34:15,854
It's <i>so</i> weird.

1341
01:34:15,916 --> 01:34:18,988
This hitman, right?
He takes his baseball bat...

1342
01:34:19,053 --> 01:34:21,329
and right when Bobby's
on the ground--

1343
01:34:22,356 --> 01:34:24,302
he's like gurgling
like a baby--

1344
01:34:24,358 --> 01:34:27,805
shooting blood and
his guts are hanging out--

1345
01:34:29,597 --> 01:34:30,803
and his eyes--

1346
01:34:31,866 --> 01:34:34,540
It was <i>so</i> sick, his eyes were
popping out of his head.

1347
01:34:34,602 --> 01:34:37,310
He takes his baseball bat
and he swings it,

1348
01:34:37,371 --> 01:34:39,442
and he half caves
in his head.

1349
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,145
Claudia:
You watched this?

1350
01:34:41,208 --> 01:34:43,154
Yeah, I was there.
And Ali and Heather.

1351
01:34:44,278 --> 01:34:45,256
We were all there.

1352
01:34:45,312 --> 01:34:47,553
And we saw it,
most of it.

1353
01:34:47,615 --> 01:34:49,595
Heather,
you met her, right?

1354
01:34:50,985 --> 01:34:52,987
She's <i>so</i> strange.

1355
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:55,728
She gets that blank look,
like she's not even there.

1356
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:58,896
And she starts hugging
her knees and rocking...

1357
01:34:58,959 --> 01:35:01,667
like she's totally fried.
And then, after...

1358
01:35:01,729 --> 01:35:04,232
<i>she lusts shrugs
and says “Fuck them.“</i>

1359
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:15,318
- Lisa--
- Listen, Claudia.

1360
01:35:16,544 --> 01:35:18,490
I'm really worried
about how we left him.

1361
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,822
He's just out there,
where anyone can see him.

1362
01:35:20,881 --> 01:35:22,622
I can't stop thinking
about it, you know?

1363
01:35:24,485 --> 01:35:27,022
Like someone walking up
and finding him.

1364
01:35:28,189 --> 01:35:31,500
We should've hid him better,
pushed him in the canal more.

1365
01:35:31,559 --> 01:35:35,200
At least the gators would've got him
or he would have sunk, but--

1366
01:35:35,262 --> 01:35:36,935
That's why I came over.

1367
01:35:36,997 --> 01:35:37,975
Claudia: What?

1368
01:35:39,033 --> 01:35:41,775
Claudia,
I need to go out there.

1369
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:45,143
Can you borrow your mother's car?
I need a ride.

1370
01:35:45,206 --> 01:35:46,810
I need someone
to help me move it.

1371
01:35:46,874 --> 01:35:49,081
- Claudia: It?
- The body.

1372
01:35:51,545 --> 01:35:55,493
- You murdered Bobby Kent?
- I didn't say I murdered anybody.

1373
01:35:55,549 --> 01:35:59,793
They killed him.
I won't even say they murdered him.

1374
01:35:59,854 --> 01:36:03,063
- He was fighting back.
- He was?

1375
01:36:03,124 --> 01:36:04,933
Yeah!
He was trying to get away.

1376
01:36:04,992 --> 01:36:07,472
Begging Marty.
You know,

1377
01:36:07,528 --> 01:36:12,500
saying, "I'm sorry, please.
I'll do anything, don't kill me."

1378
01:36:12,566 --> 01:36:14,307
Right when he said that,

1379
01:36:14,368 --> 01:36:16,473
Marty walked up to him

1380
01:36:16,537 --> 01:36:19,177
and whacked him in the heart
with his diving knife.

1381
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:22,414
The whole thing
was just totally extreme!

1382
01:36:24,245 --> 01:36:25,781
Oh. Wait.

1383
01:36:25,846 --> 01:36:28,884
You want somebody to take you
out there to move a body?

1384
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:32,396
I don't" anybody crazy
enough to do that--

1385
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:35,923
Fine, fine.
We won't go move it.

1386
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:39,437
We'll just go out there see
if the tire tracks are gone.

1387
01:36:39,493 --> 01:36:41,769
No way, Lisa.
No way.

1388
01:36:41,829 --> 01:36:44,070
- Come on!
- No!

1389
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,771
Look, I gotta go.
I'm late for work.

1390
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:48,905
I'm supposed to be
in Pizza Hut in half an hour.

1391
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:52,746
Well, screw you, Claudia.
All I wanted was a ride--

1392
01:36:53,908 --> 01:36:57,412
I hope you have a problem someday,
<i>so</i> you can ask me for help.

1393
01:36:57,478 --> 01:36:58,513
Shit!

1394
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:02,555
You don't have to make
a federal case out of it.

1395
01:37:02,616 --> 01:37:04,289
I just asked
for a fuckin' ride.

1396
01:37:05,419 --> 01:37:07,729
Lisa: Claudia, keep
your fuckin' mouth shut.

1397
01:37:15,129 --> 01:37:17,075
Claudia's mom:
Was that Lisa leaving?

1398
01:37:17,131 --> 01:37:18,303
Yeah.

1399
01:37:18,365 --> 01:37:20,777
- Is everything okay?
- Claudia: Yeah!

1400
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:24,044
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

1401
01:37:24,104 --> 01:37:26,380
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

1402
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,386
I gotta go to work, Mom.

1403
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:35,358
Mom, what if you witnessed
a crime, like a murder,

1404
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:38,863
and you called the hotline
but didn't give your name.

1405
01:37:38,919 --> 01:37:40,455
Would that be legal?

1406
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:42,296
I don't know
what you mean, Ali.

1407
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:44,700
What kind of a crime?

1408
01:37:44,758 --> 01:37:46,169
A murder,
I told you.

1409
01:37:47,761 --> 01:37:50,002
What are you kids
up to, Ali?

1410
01:37:50,064 --> 01:37:52,044
I was just asking,
for Christ's sakes.

1411
01:37:52,099 --> 01:37:54,101
I mean,
would it still count?

1412
01:37:54,168 --> 01:37:55,909
You could still say
you reported it, right?

1413
01:37:57,605 --> 01:38:00,779
If you saw a murder,
and just called the hotline,

1414
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:03,321
and reported it and didn't give
your name or anything,

1415
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:06,449
- would that be enough?
- Would it?

1416
01:38:06,513 --> 01:38:10,757
I don't know the law, but...
I don't think so.

1417
01:38:10,818 --> 01:38:13,298
I think you would still
have to say who you were.

1418
01:38:13,354 --> 01:38:15,891
- But why wouldn't it--
- Why are you asking these questions?

1419
01:38:15,956 --> 01:38:19,494
Why wouldn't it count?
You could still say you reported it.

1420
01:38:20,761 --> 01:38:23,207
Ali, are you talking about
a "murder" murder?

1421
01:38:24,265 --> 01:38:27,269
I guess.
This guy kind of got killed.

1422
01:38:27,334 --> 01:38:29,814
Why would you
just call a hotline?

1423
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:32,441
I was just asking, God!

1424
01:38:32,506 --> 01:38:35,009
(phone ringing)

1425
01:38:37,878 --> 01:38:40,222
( ringing continues )

1426
01:38:48,188 --> 01:38:49,428
Hello?

1427
01:38:49,490 --> 01:38:51,231
Marty,
where have you been?

1428
01:38:51,292 --> 01:38:53,397
Somebody made an anonymous
call to the cops.

1429
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:54,996
Lisa:
They know about Bobby.

1430
01:38:55,062 --> 01:38:57,736
- Have they found him?
- I don't know.

1431
01:38:57,798 --> 01:38:59,641
Somebody told them
he got murdered.

1432
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:01,941
- Murdered?
- That's what they said.

1433
01:39:02,002 --> 01:39:04,505
- They used that word?
- Yes!

1434
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:07,986
Did you fuckin'
talk to somebody?

1435
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:11,023
No, I didn't talk
to anybody, Jesus!

1436
01:40:33,927 --> 01:40:36,339
( Coughing )

1437
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:50,249
- You're up early.
- I'm going to the skate park.

1438
01:40:51,478 --> 01:40:53,515
What did you do
with the earring?

1439
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:55,082
It fell out.

1440
01:41:24,244 --> 01:41:25,723
I love you, buddy.

1441
01:41:26,847 --> 01:41:28,258
Yeah,
I love you too.

1442
01:41:38,725 --> 01:41:40,329
Who the fuck
did you tell, Lisa?

1443
01:41:40,394 --> 01:41:42,874
It wasn't me, bitch.
For all I know, it's you.

1444
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,876
The cops are onto us,
we have to come up there.

1445
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:46,377
Not with police on you,
you don't.

1446
01:41:46,433 --> 01:41:48,310
You gotta hide us.

1447
01:41:49,436 --> 01:41:52,315
They know how Bobby
died and everything.

1448
01:41:52,372 --> 01:41:54,079
We're all
in this together, right?

1449
01:42:05,285 --> 01:42:08,129
- Alice, geez!
- Ali: It's okay!

1450
01:42:08,188 --> 01:42:10,828
It's all right.
I've got it under control.

1451
01:42:10,891 --> 01:42:12,871
I don't want them
to know where I sleep.

1452
01:42:12,926 --> 01:42:16,635
- This is going to stop, right now.
- Move me in my own apartment then.

1453
01:42:16,697 --> 01:42:19,268
- An apartment?
- Godfucking damn it!

1454
01:42:19,333 --> 01:42:22,610
We need to hide because they're
gonna come to your house.

1455
01:42:22,669 --> 01:42:24,808
Baby, who are they?

1456
01:42:24,872 --> 01:42:28,115
Alice seems to think that
some of her friends killed somebody.

1457
01:42:29,209 --> 01:42:31,621
Who in the hell,
Virginia?

1458
01:42:31,678 --> 01:42:34,249
- That is something for the police.
- Ali: No police, because

1459
01:42:34,314 --> 01:42:36,157
a Mafia hitman did this.

1460
01:42:36,216 --> 01:42:38,958
He said that if we told
anybody, he'd kill us.

1461
01:42:39,019 --> 01:42:41,693
Is this about getting
your own apartment?

1462
01:42:41,755 --> 01:42:45,202
- No! I don't want an apartment!
- Hey! Honey, hey.

1463
01:42:45,259 --> 01:42:46,738
Fuck.

1464
01:42:46,793 --> 01:42:47,999
- Don't touch me!
- Baby--

1465
01:42:48,061 --> 01:42:49,734
- Baby!
- Don't touch me!

1466
01:42:49,796 --> 01:42:52,299
- (Ali screaming )
- Ali, chill!

1467
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,876
- That's it.
- He's not in the Mafia.

1468
01:42:55,936 --> 01:42:57,540
Lisa: You don't know
what you're talking about.

1469
01:42:57,604 --> 01:42:59,811
- He must be protecting you.
- Protecting me?

1470
01:42:59,873 --> 01:43:02,149
I'm his brother.
That lazy fucker protects dick.

1471
01:43:02,209 --> 01:43:04,086
He doesn't have a job.

1472
01:43:04,144 --> 01:43:06,055
What about
the Crazy Motherfuckers?

1473
01:43:06,113 --> 01:43:08,150
He wanted to be in Davy Boyz
but chickened out.

1474
01:43:08,215 --> 01:43:09,751
Got the tattoo instead.

1475
01:43:09,816 --> 01:43:11,693
You ought
to turn yourselves in.

1476
01:43:14,555 --> 01:43:17,161
But if I turn my self in,
I may go to jail.

1477
01:43:17,224 --> 01:43:19,465
She's afraid
they'll put her in jail.

1478
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:22,973
- Tell her you'll write to her.
- Hey man, I'll write to you.

1479
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:28,204
( Dial tone )

1480
01:43:43,817 --> 01:43:47,321
- TV host: Good toss, Laura--
- ( pounding on the door)

1481
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:54,137
Sheriff's office!
Where is Marty?

1482
01:43:54,194 --> 01:43:56,196
Where is he?
Let's go!

1483
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:04,045
Sheriff's office,
don't move.

1484
01:44:04,104 --> 01:44:06,277
- Where's Marty?
- Mother: In the bedroom.

1485
01:44:12,512 --> 01:44:14,185
- Sheriff's office!
- What's going on?

1486
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:16,751
Does the name
Bobby Kent ring a bell?

1487
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:22,025
( Indistinct chatter )

1488
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:27,561
Officer: Hurry.

1489
01:45:04,097 --> 01:45:06,668
( Indistinct <i>crowd</i> chatter)

1490
01:45:18,111 --> 01:45:22,059
I'm due in seven weeks. If it's a boy,
I'll name him Marty.

1491
01:45:23,984 --> 01:45:25,895
Will you send me
a picture?

1492
01:45:25,952 --> 01:45:26,987
Yeah.

1493
01:45:27,054 --> 01:45:29,660
Are they gonna
let you out to have it?

1494
01:45:29,723 --> 01:45:31,725
Shut up, bitch.
You're a fuckin' snitch.

1495
01:45:31,792 --> 01:45:33,533
You cut a deal.
We all know that.

1496
01:45:34,594 --> 01:45:35,698
Is it true?

1497
01:45:36,797 --> 01:45:39,573
Marty: Shit, Ali.
You don't know that yet?

1498
01:45:39,633 --> 01:45:42,113
Jesus,
who is your lawyer?

1499
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:45,673
Marty: Her and Dumbo here have been
snitching on us to save their asses,

1500
01:45:45,739 --> 01:45:47,582
otherwise
we wouldn't be here today.

1501
01:45:47,641 --> 01:45:50,986
Psst! Sorry ass snitch
motherfucker!

1502
01:45:51,044 --> 01:45:52,455
I know
what you're doing.

1503
01:45:52,512 --> 01:45:55,550
- You're gonna regret this.
- Lisa: Leave him alone, asshole!

1504
01:45:55,615 --> 01:45:57,151
You've done enough
to ruin his life.

1505
01:45:57,217 --> 01:45:58,662
Shut the fuck up!

1506
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:01,996
- Your fat cousin ruined it.
- I don't know what I'm doing here.

1507
01:46:02,055 --> 01:46:04,228
I didn't do shit.
I don't know why I'm here.

1508
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:05,269
You stabbed him, dude.

1509
01:46:06,326 --> 01:46:07,327
What are
you crying about?

1510
