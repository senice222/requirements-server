1
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:57,527
I want you to suck my big dick.

2
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:00,894
Marty honey, dinner.

3
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,764
I want you to lick my balls.

4
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,167
<i>His cock?</i>

5
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:48,737
<i>His cock was beautiful.</i>

6
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,716
And he ate me out for an hour.

7
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,649
Lisa, you know,

8
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:59,485
it's all about attitude.
If you want it, you can get it.

9
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:01,889
You just got to get your fuckin' ass on the beach.

10
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:05,451
- Work for it.
- Whatever.

11
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,874
Excuse me, sandwich boy?

12
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,747
Aren't you supposed to wear gloves,

13
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:31,253
'cause I don't know where those hands have been.

14
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,725
Fuckin' pigs, man!

15
00:02:42,054 --> 00:02:44,534
- My name's Marty, what's yours?
- Just give me the sub, asshole.

16
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,662
Ask the bitches to meet us, fuckhole! We'll party.

17
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:51,435
We're going surfing, at 3:00.

18
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:53,636
If you want to meet us at North Beach.

19
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:58,938
Maybe we'll think about it.

20
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:01,382
Great, babe, you can be my date.

21
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,783
My friend here will take that one.

22
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:04,286
Hey, fuck you, man.

23
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,964
- Those guys were fine.
- He was making fun of me.

24
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:25,270
No shit. He was just being
an asshole. Guys are like that.

25
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:27,277
But the other one, the shorter one--

26
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,074
- The cute one.
- Yeah, Marty.

27
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:31,114
He acted like he wanted to meet you.

28
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,379
- Meet you, you mean.
- No, his buddy's got dibs on me.

29
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,078
His buddy's the boss.

30
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:37,779
I've never been around such a hunk.

31
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:38,787
Oh!

32
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,928
- Cute butt.
- Yeah.

33
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,064
He's sweet. The other one's an asshole.

34
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:13,422
You wanna go to a party?

35
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:16,682
Sure.

36
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,366
- You're a pretty hot surfer.
- Thanks.

37
00:04:24,423 --> 00:04:25,959
You could go pro.

38
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:29,832
What planet are you living on?

39
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,067
Earth, fucker!

40
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,168
Compared to you, he's fuckin' Kobe Bryant.

41
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,922
- What do you guys want?
- Go get a bottle of tequila.

42
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:55,591
Can you give me some money? I only got six bucks.

43
00:04:55,654 --> 00:04:56,689
What was that, boy?

44
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,702
Was it "Yes sir, boss. I'll buy
that booze for you now?"

45
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,462
What I thought, bitch!

46
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,974
You're an asshole.

47
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:14,549
Baby, you know what I like.

48
00:05:15,874 --> 00:05:19,048
Come on up here.
I'm starting to dig you a little bit.

49
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:28,893
Damn, baby.

50
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,011
- Welcome to the party, bitch!
- Fuck!

51
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:54,151
Take your pants off.

52
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:55,556
Come on, baby.

53
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,491
You're fuckin' beautiful.

54
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:08,571
Back up.

55
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:14,936
Yeah.

56
00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:21,610
Good morning.

57
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:34,454
- I got a new boyfriend, Ma.
- A new what?

58
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:38,694
- A new boyfriend.
- A boyfriend?

59
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:40,957
What kind?

60
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,064
A hunk.

61
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:45,133
Really?

62
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:48,794
Yeah, you're gonna meet him.

63
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:12,859
I hear your cute friend gives good phone.

64
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:17,025
Marty's the best. He'll make you come in two minutes.

65
00:08:21,193 --> 00:08:24,003
- Can I call him?
- No, he'll call you.

66
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,611
He lives with his parents, you know.

67
00:08:34,406 --> 00:08:36,215
Okay look, right now...

68
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:39,381
$100 if he gets on stage and dances.

69
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:43,584
I hope you know you're getting up there.

70
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,151
<i>No way, man. No way.</i>

71
00:08:45,217 --> 00:08:47,754
Come on. A hundred bucks is a hundred bucks.

72
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,730
I can make the money somewhere else.

73
00:08:49,788 --> 00:08:53,167
Get the fuck up there right now, it's $100.

74
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:54,431
Go!

75
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:56,438
Get up there.

76
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:08,314
Make 'em proud.

77
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:26,495
160, 180, 200...

78
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:28,622
Plus what you got, that's 300.

79
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:32,363
What's the matter, man?

80
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:37,273
You enjoyed that, back there, didn't you?

81
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:39,434
Hell no. I ain't queer like those guys.

82
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:40,408
Bullshit.

83
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:42,843
Bullshit, I think you like dick.

84
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:45,677
Ain't got to lie to me, boy. I know you like dick.

85
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:46,875
Fuck you!

86
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:47,973
- Look out!

87
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,313
- Man!

88
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:52,218
You fuck, you fucked up my fuckin' car!

89
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,255
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck!

90
00:10:53,678 --> 00:10:56,158
Watch the fuck out! You're gonna make me wreck!

91
00:10:56,214 --> 00:10:59,821
- You stupid fuck!
- Oh, fuck!

92
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:02,923
- You piece of shit!
- Motherfucker!

93
00:11:05,824 --> 00:11:08,930
- Fuck this goddamn shit!

94
00:11:10,362 --> 00:11:11,500
Marty?

95
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:14,304
Hey, get in the car.

96
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,376
Fuck you, man.

97
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:33,592
I'm sorry, man. Let's just go.

98
00:11:34,786 --> 00:11:36,629
Let's go, I'm sorry.

99
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:38,759
Get your fuckin' hands off me, Bobby.

100
00:11:39,891 --> 00:11:41,461
I'm really sorry.

101
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:44,573
You're my best friend.

102
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:47,135
Okay?

103
00:12:12,157 --> 00:12:14,034
Coming inside or what, Lisa?

104
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:16,038
No, I'm waiting for my new boyfriend.

105
00:12:16,094 --> 00:12:18,096
You met Marty, haven't you, Claudia?

106
00:12:18,163 --> 00:12:19,471
No, I don't think so.

107
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,102
- Is he cute?
- He a hunk.

108
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:18,333
- Aaah!
- What the fuck?!

109
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,425
I'm next!

110
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:23,995
Lover bug?

111
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,134
Oh, my God.

112
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:37,047
Can we move?

113
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:42,653
Haven't we already discussed this?

114
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:44,455
Can I have a car, then?

115
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:49,398
Why can't we just move out of this dumb neighborhood?

116
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,594
Marty,

117
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:57,128
we can't just quit our jobs and leave
because our son's having problems.

118
00:13:57,195 --> 00:13:58,401
<i>Fine.</i>

119
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,402
Fuck it!

120
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,513
Maybe we could hang. My cousin gave me some weed.

121
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:46,783
That's cool.

122
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:25,392
First time I ever smoked weed,

123
00:15:26,651 --> 00:15:28,597
it was in the eighth grade,

124
00:15:28,653 --> 00:15:31,497
and I knew a lot of kids who had been doing <i>it...</i>

125
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,127
but I was always afraid to,

126
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:36,297
'cause I was raised strict Catholic.

127
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:39,706
I was taught that the worst
thing you could do in life,

128
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:41,641
would be to make your mother cry.

129
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:46,146
She always told me if she caught me
messing with dope it would kill her.

130
00:15:47,505 --> 00:15:51,043
But Bobby... he was always bugging me about it.

131
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:53,646
It was <i>so</i> fucking important to him.

132
00:15:53,712 --> 00:15:56,249
If he did it, I had to do it.

133
00:15:56,314 --> 00:15:57,691
<i>So one day...</i>

134
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,822
we were at the bus stop, waiting for the bus,

135
00:16:01,886 --> 00:16:03,888
and I smoked some with Bobby.

136
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:09,130
And he told me the shit was, like, weak.

137
00:16:09,194 --> 00:16:11,105
That I'd barely even feel it.

138
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,469
He must have fuckin' dusted
that shit or something, 'cause...

139
00:16:16,534 --> 00:16:20,414
the whole fuckin' world warped around me, man.

140
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:23,112
I had no idea how to handle it.

141
00:16:23,174 --> 00:16:25,916
The only thing I could think to do was run.

142
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:32,053
I take off, Bobby's running
behind me, laughing like crazy.

143
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:35,530
I get home and I get in my bed and
I pull the covers over my head...

144
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:41,568
Like bury myself under a pillow.
I was <i>so</i> fuckin' scared.

145
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,705
Bobby yanks the covers off of me.

146
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:51,479
- You know what I did?
- No.

147
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,845
You know what I did?

148
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:56,715
What baby?

149
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,386
I fuckin' pissed all over myself.

150
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:08,831
I love you, Marty.

151
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:18,069
I love you <i>so</i> much I can't even
believe how much I love you.

152
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:22,376
I would do anything for you.

153
00:18:32,604 --> 00:18:34,675
Hi Lisa. What's up?

154
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,058
Oh, man!

155
00:18:42,113 --> 00:18:44,787
- Whose is it?
- It's Marty's.

156
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:48,422
Shit. Couldn't it be Bobby's?
Haven't you fucked them both?

157
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:51,125
No, it's Marty's.

158
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:55,335
She says that like she actually knows.

159
00:18:58,563 --> 00:19:00,907
Watch what he does. Holy shit!

160
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:04,538
Watch, he's not done. Eat his heart, Derek.

161
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,173
Hey, asshole, I don't know
how to eat his heart, nobody does.

162
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,195
I know who your girlfriend is, your right hand.

163
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,207
- Derek, I need a ride.
- Can't you see I'm busy?

164
00:19:32,263 --> 00:19:34,106
I need a ride over to Marty's.

165
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:39,440
Okay, let's go, cuz.

166
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:49,555
I need to talk to you.

167
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:51,321
- Later. I'm busy.
- Now!

168
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:55,991
What?

169
00:20:01,726 --> 00:20:04,866
- Hey dude. What's happening?
- Nothing.

170
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:07,967
Come on in, let me show you
what me and Marty are working on.

171
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:09,306
It's definitely cool.

172
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,847
Come here, man.

173
00:20:14,939 --> 00:20:16,111
Take a look at this.

174
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,245
We picked up this guy from the Copa.

175
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:23,452
Got him to do all this fucked up shit.

176
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,425
I can't believe you got a guy to do this.

177
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:27,394
Yeah, it's fuckin' disgusting.

178
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,165
It's nasty, Dude.

179
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:31,962
- You and Marty did this?
- Yeah.

180
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,027
We're gonna sell this to porno shops.
They'll pay top dollar for this.

181
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:37,505
This is gross, dude. I'm gonna wait outside.

182
00:20:38,663 --> 00:20:40,665
You don't like our fuckin' tape?

183
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:43,372
No, it's gross shit, man. I don't like it at all.

184
00:20:43,434 --> 00:20:45,311
I don't. I'm gonna wait outside.

185
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:47,679
Okay.

186
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:55,921
I'm not ready to be no dad, Lisa.

187
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,789
Let go of me, please!

188
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:00,329
You'll the money and get it fixed.

189
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:04,299
You fucking hear me, God damn it?

190
00:21:04,355 --> 00:21:07,359
- Huh? Answer me.
- Let go of her, asshole!

191
00:21:07,425 --> 00:21:10,702
- We were just messing around.
- You're just messing around!

192
00:21:10,762 --> 00:21:12,969
Does this look like messing around, asshole?!

193
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:13,975
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

194
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:16,876
Jesus Christ, you call this messing around? Look!

195
00:21:16,934 --> 00:21:18,777
- I said I was fuckin' sorry!
- Fuck you!

196
00:21:18,836 --> 00:21:21,146
- Motherfucker!
- Fuck you! Get out of here.

197
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:22,513
- Bring it, motherfucker!
- Fuck!

198
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,383
- Motherfucker, bring it!
- The fuck is with you?

199
00:21:31,382 --> 00:21:33,293
She's fuckin' pregnant, man.

200
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:37,827
She's fuckin' pregnant!

201
00:21:39,657 --> 00:21:41,159
It's fuckin'...

202
00:21:43,361 --> 00:21:44,897
Little motherfucker!

203
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:47,704
I'm sending my goddamn brother over there.

204
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,267
He's gonna beat the shit out of him.

205
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,176
- I mean beat the living shit--
- No Mama, please.

206
00:21:51,235 --> 00:21:54,045
I love Marty. I love him more than anything.

207
00:21:57,542 --> 00:21:59,146
I don't understand this.

208
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:04,316
I don't understand what is going on with you.

209
00:22:05,883 --> 00:22:07,794
Maybe I don't wanna know.

210
00:22:07,852 --> 00:22:11,561
Please, Ma, don't get Marty hurt.

211
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:12,930
<i>Fine.</i>

212
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,335
You need a bath, young lady.

213
00:22:20,865 --> 00:22:22,742
Clean yourself up!

214
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:04,444
It's Bobby.

215
00:23:27,465 --> 00:23:28,910
Oh, fuck!

216
00:23:28,966 --> 00:23:32,379
I paged my dealer. It's gonna be all right.

217
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,441
Hello?

218
00:23:37,508 --> 00:23:40,751
Where you've been, bitch?
I've been calling you forever.

219
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:44,759
I've been hangin' out with
this guy Donny who's totally hot.

220
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,193
You're still fucking that surfer?

221
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:52,057
I heard you're fuckin' pregnant.

222
00:23:52,123 --> 00:23:55,536
Yeah... we're totally happy.

223
00:23:55,593 --> 00:23:58,972
Guess what? His friend Bobby is so hot for you,

224
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:02,671
he wants you to come down and experiment and shit.

225
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:06,476
He's into some spooky shit even you wouldn't believe.

226
00:24:06,537 --> 00:24:07,515
Really?

227
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,720
I'll see.

228
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,899
Is Bobby nice? I mean, can he be?

229
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:37,173
I don't know, you met him.

230
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:39,613
He was an asshole when I met him.

231
00:24:42,173 --> 00:24:46,212
Bobby and I have been friends
since we were almost born, and shit.

232
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:49,322
Then he must be nice.

233
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:53,685
Yeah, I guess.

234
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,700
I haven't seen your friend, lately.

235
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,939
I said, I haven't seen Marty lately.

236
00:25:06,564 --> 00:25:08,202
That's good.

237
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:10,169
He's probably too busy with his surfing.

238
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:13,215
A game that children play at the beach.

239
00:25:16,173 --> 00:25:17,777
It's a way of life.

240
00:25:17,842 --> 00:25:19,549
Really?

241
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,146
Did your friend Marty tell you that?

242
00:25:22,747 --> 00:25:23,725
What kind of life <i>is...</i>

243
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:28,126
splashing around in the waves and saying " Wheee!"?

244
00:25:30,421 --> 00:25:32,162
May I be excused?

245
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:38,736
No. Son, you are smart,

246
00:25:38,796 --> 00:25:40,707
you have ambition, you have presence.

247
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:45,214
Your friend Marty is living
a life of complete aimlessness.

248
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:48,341
I don't know what happened to him.
He used to be a good kid.

249
00:25:48,406 --> 00:25:50,682
He's got no ambition, no fire in his gut, nothing.

250
00:25:50,741 --> 00:25:52,448
I don't want you spending <i>so</i> much time with him.

251
00:25:54,712 --> 00:25:57,192
I will move this family far away from here

252
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,886
before I see you waste your life away.

253
00:25:58,949 --> 00:26:01,190
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

254
00:26:03,888 --> 00:26:06,095
I booked a piano lesson for you Thursday.

255
00:26:07,158 --> 00:26:09,035
That fit into your schedule?

256

00:30:30,988 --> 00:30:34,299
I told you not to hang out with him and I meant it.

318

- I'm thinking about selling the house.
- No, please, Dad.

- He didn't even finish high school.

324
00:30:52,743 --> 00:30:55,656
I know, he's a loser. I know that, I see that.

325
00:30:56,714 --> 00:30:59,194
They came over to say hello. That's it, I swear.

326
00:31:01,852 --> 00:31:03,195
Dad.

327
00:31:06,357 --> 00:31:07,893
Hey Bob, you know...

328
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:11,767
I saw a stereo place for sale on the way home.

329
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,775
It was like the one we talked about,

330
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:16,368
only it didn't have the window tinting.

331
00:31:16,433 --> 00:31:18,242
Bobby, you can do it.

332
00:31:18,302 --> 00:31:20,908
You can do it, Bob. I know you can.

333
00:31:20,971 --> 00:31:23,315
I can help you. I'll get you all set up.

334
00:31:24,475 --> 00:31:27,718
Bobby, it's the best future
you can have in this country.

335
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:29,451
To be your own master.

336
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:38,800
If I do this for you, can we hire Marty?

337
00:31:47,598 --> 00:31:49,600
Wow, you're really good.

338
00:31:50,668 --> 00:31:52,841
- Where are you from?
- Michigan.

339
00:31:53,904 --> 00:31:56,043
I used to be better when I was competing.

340
00:31:56,106 --> 00:31:57,813
Why did you stop?

341
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,121
I don't know.

342
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,720
- You be good, little man, all right?
- All right. See you.

343
00:32:18,262 --> 00:32:20,071
What do you want to do?

344
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,736
I wanna ask you something, Marty.

345
00:32:23,801 --> 00:32:26,338
Why do you let Bobby treat you the way he does?

346
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:27,711
What?

347
00:32:28,706 --> 00:32:30,686
Why do you let Bobby treat you like he does?

348
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,880
Hit you and stuff and make fun of you?

349
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:36,615
He disses you right to your face
in front of everyone.

350
00:32:38,949 --> 00:32:41,486
Derek thinks you guys are queer for each other.

351
00:32:41,552 --> 00:32:43,691
Derek's an asshole.

352
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:44,789
You know what?

353
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:50,198
- I love you.
- Shut up.

354
00:32:51,395 --> 00:32:53,534
I do. I love you and I care about you,

355
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,076
and I don't want to see you suffer.

356
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,006
I don't wanna see Bobby picking on you ever again.

357
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:05,753
Bobby...

358
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,084
What?

359
00:33:10,681 --> 00:33:14,356
He's been like this since
we were little fuckin' kids.

360
00:33:16,053 --> 00:33:20,559
He's always been like this.

361
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:24,128
He's always beat the fuck
out of me, whenever he wanted.

362
00:33:24,194 --> 00:33:27,334
There's not a goddamn thing I can do about it.

363
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:31,078
I begged my fuckin' parents to move--

364
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,944
You could move away yourself.

365
00:33:34,004 --> 00:33:36,780
I'm not even a high school graduate.

366
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:41,111
Yeah, I know. Tell me about it.

367
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,061
So there is nothing we can do to stop him ever.

368
00:33:46,116 --> 00:33:48,357
We could kill him. That's about it.

369
00:33:51,388 --> 00:33:53,026
That's what I was thinking.

370
00:33:54,124 --> 00:33:55,102
What?

371
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,362
What are you talking about?

372
00:33:59,696 --> 00:34:02,233
- Bobby.
- What about Bobby?

373
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,904
What if he was gone?

374
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,549
What kind of weird shit are you talking about?

375
00:34:11,975 --> 00:34:14,216
What if we killed him?

376
00:34:14,278 --> 00:34:16,588
Are you fuckin' nuts?

377
00:34:20,751 --> 00:34:22,958
He treats everyone like shit.

378
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,967
He's always mean, he's always cruel.

379
00:34:27,057 --> 00:34:28,536
Beats you up.

380
00:34:30,127 --> 00:34:33,370
He's even too weird for Ali
and she's into everything!

381
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:37,401
He's the source of everybody's troubles.

382
00:34:38,468 --> 00:34:41,005
And even still, he's gonna finish high school

383
00:34:41,071 --> 00:34:43,381
and go to college and probably get rich.

384
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,421
Yeah, and I'm gonna be delivering
pizzas to him in Weston.

385
00:34:49,813 --> 00:34:51,918
How would we get a gun?

386
00:34:51,982 --> 00:34:53,655
My ma has one.

387
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,431
Shit, that motherfucker...

388
00:35:03,694 --> 00:35:05,401
has fuckin' dissed <i>me...</i>

389
00:35:05,462 --> 00:35:08,705
and treated me like shit my whole goddamn life.

390
00:35:10,267 --> 00:35:11,644
Let's kill him.

391
00:35:22,446 --> 00:35:23,982
No shit!

392
00:35:33,624 --> 00:35:37,162
- You are one crazy bitch.
- No I'm not.

393
00:35:37,227 --> 00:35:39,434
No I'm not. Marty agrees with me.

394
00:35:39,496 --> 00:35:42,170
This is the way for everyone
to take care of their problems,

395
00:35:42,232 --> 00:35:44,872
because Bobby is everybody's fuckin' problem.

396
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,505
What do you want me to do?

397
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:49,551
- Come down and help us.
- Oh, man...

398
00:35:50,674 --> 00:35:53,245
Wow. What are you gonna do it with?

399
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:56,257
I don't know. A gun or a knife, I guess.

400
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,667
Bitch.

401
00:36:07,724 --> 00:36:08,896
Good.

402
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:13,533
- What are you doing?
- Just talking to my dog.

403
00:36:13,597 --> 00:36:16,077
- Are you high?
- Not enough.

404
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:20,246
My mom's in here and she's like--

405
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:23,410
she's like making plans for my 18th birthday party.

406
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:26,852
She's gonna have a cake, a <i>clown</i> and all that shit.

407
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,015
You know, like when you were a kid.

408
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:31,685
I think she's happy here.

409
00:36:31,748 --> 00:36:33,785
I think she likes it a lot better than New Jersey.

410
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:36,228
I need to talk to you about something.

411
00:36:36,286 --> 00:36:37,765
I've got to go to Fort Lauderdale

412
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,461
to help my friend Lisa kill this asshole named Bobby.

413
00:36:40,524 --> 00:36:42,526
I like it when you pull my hair.

414
00:36:42,592 --> 00:36:43,935
Cool.

415
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:46,906
Shut up. You won't kill this guy.

416
00:36:46,964 --> 00:36:48,409
Yeah.

417
00:36:48,465 --> 00:36:50,672
- No.
- Yeah.

418
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:53,078
- No.
- Yeah.

419
00:36:53,136 --> 00:36:55,309
Kill him? Like kill him in real life?

420
00:36:55,372 --> 00:36:57,318
- Kill him?
- Yes.

421
00:36:57,374 --> 00:36:59,945
- Like kill him, he's dead?
- Yes.

422
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:03,784
- No.
- Yes.

423
00:37:05,482 --> 00:37:07,689
Whoa, Ali. That's some heavy shit.

424
00:37:07,751 --> 00:37:10,197
- You want to go with me?

425
00:37:10,253 --> 00:37:12,062
I got some really good dope in.

426
00:37:12,122 --> 00:37:14,796
- Well okay, sure.

427
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,269
I'll go with you.

428
00:37:16,326 --> 00:37:17,430
- Hello?
- Hey!

429
00:37:17,494 --> 00:37:19,201
Where the fuck are you, bitch?

430
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,934
Back in rehab.

431
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:24,309
I'm kind of messed up, Ali.

432
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:25,540
Tweak.

433
00:37:26,937 --> 00:37:29,508
Listen, I gotta go down to Fort Lauderdale,

434
00:37:29,573 --> 00:37:32,019
to help my friend Lisa kill this asshole named Bobby.

435
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:34,578
But if you want, I can come pick you up.

436
00:37:37,748 --> 00:37:39,193
Okay.

437
00:37:40,951 --> 00:37:45,400
What if we drive by his house,
when he's in his yard or some shit?

438
00:37:45,455 --> 00:37:47,435
Shoot him down.

439
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:49,971
Cops will think it's a gang thing.

440
00:37:51,361 --> 00:37:54,501
Shit, Lisa. That a fuckin' great idea.

441
00:38:18,622 --> 00:38:20,499
Ow! Fuck, man!

442
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:25,831
Thanks for getting me, Ali.

443
00:38:25,896 --> 00:38:27,933
I stick with my homies.

444
00:38:27,998 --> 00:38:30,171
Is that joint all you're holding?

445
00:38:31,368 --> 00:38:33,439
We've got a glove box full of acid.

446
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,148
Any tweak?

447
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:40,711
How was rehab?

448
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:56,661
Just about raped Ali last time she came.

449
00:38:58,762 --> 00:39:01,140
He beats me. He's raped me.

450
00:39:01,198 --> 00:39:03,610
The worst part is the way he picks on Marty.

451
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:07,240
He treats him like a dog or a slave or something.

452
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:09,011
Pisses me off <i>so</i> bad I can't stand it.

453
00:39:09,072 --> 00:39:11,052
So, what are you gonna do, Lisa?

454
00:39:11,108 --> 00:39:13,019
I'm gonna kill him.

455
00:39:13,076 --> 00:39:16,319
- That's some heavy shit.
- Yeah, it is!

456
00:39:16,379 --> 00:39:19,053
How are you gonna do it?

457
00:39:19,116 --> 00:39:21,619
Why are you guys <i>so</i> serious?

458
00:39:21,685 --> 00:39:24,165
We're gonna fix Bobby Kent's ass.

459
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:25,495
Cool!

460
00:39:26,556 --> 00:39:28,934
Holy shit!

461
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:31,336
Can we get some napkins?

462
00:39:31,394 --> 00:39:33,465
- I'll be back.
- And a straw.

463
00:39:34,898 --> 00:39:36,775
How are we gonna do it?

464
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,473
I was thinking, we could drive by his house,

465
00:39:39,536 --> 00:39:42,540
when he's in his yard, and shoot him down.

466
00:39:42,606 --> 00:39:44,552
The cops will think it's a gang thing.

467
00:39:44,608 --> 00:39:46,451
Oh, no. Somebody will see us.

468
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,957
I know. We can go into his house while he's sleeping,

469
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,549
and stab the fucker in the neck.

470
00:39:51,615 --> 00:39:54,357
- I brought my survival knife.
- He's got a doberman.

471
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:56,397
The best way is just to shoot him.

472
00:39:56,453 --> 00:39:58,956
- How do we get a gun?
- My ma has one.

473
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:10,576
We can't bonk him over
the head and drag him off somewhere.

474
00:40:10,634 --> 00:40:11,612
<i>How come?</i>

475
00:40:12,669 --> 00:40:14,205
He's too strong.

476
00:40:14,271 --> 00:40:16,410
Wait a second. Haven't you even met him before?

477
00:40:16,473 --> 00:40:18,453
- No.
- No, me neither.

478
00:40:18,508 --> 00:40:21,853
- What's this guy like?
- He's an asshole.

479
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:30,091
Holy shit. What he fuck is that for?

480
00:40:30,153 --> 00:40:32,793
To kill Bobby Kent, don't you remember?

481
00:40:32,856 --> 00:40:34,802
Oh, yeah.

482
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:37,099
Hey, won't that get blood everywhere?

483
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,436
Yeah, we're gonna have to plan
where we're gonna do it.

484
00:40:42,532 --> 00:40:45,570
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Mrs. Connelly.

485
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:50,213
These are my friends from Palm Bay.
This is Donny and this is Heather.

486
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:53,482
- Hi, Donny. Hi, Heather.
- Hey.

487
00:40:53,543 --> 00:40:56,353
- Did you kids have supper?
- Yes ma'am.

488
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,153
Okay.

489
00:41:03,687 --> 00:41:05,667
Are we really gonna do this?

490
00:41:06,623 --> 00:41:09,570
Jesus Christ, Ali, can you get this guy to shut up?

491
00:41:09,626 --> 00:41:10,627
Ow!

492
00:41:10,694 --> 00:41:12,196
- Shut up, Donny.
- You shut up!

493
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:13,969
We'll have to find a way to get him alone.

494
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,873
No shit, he's gotta be by himself.

495
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:19,846
It's easier to kill someone
when they're by themselves.

496
00:41:19,903 --> 00:41:21,678
Yeah.

497
00:41:21,738 --> 00:41:24,218
Ali, what if you offer to fuck him again?

498
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:27,551
Wait a minute, isn't this the guy who raped you?

499
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:29,852
What do you mean... like bait?

500
00:41:29,913 --> 00:41:31,017
Yeah.

501
00:41:31,081 --> 00:41:32,788
It's not enough for him to go.

502
00:41:35,218 --> 00:41:38,290
What if I offered to let him dog out my 5.0?

503
00:41:38,355 --> 00:41:41,131
- Excuse me--
- And then offer to fuck me again.

504
00:41:41,191 --> 00:41:44,138
He can drive you out to the barrens
in Weston by the Glades.

505
00:41:44,194 --> 00:41:45,798
Wait a second... Okay?

506
00:41:45,862 --> 00:41:48,342
If Ali's supposed to be banging Bobby,

507
00:41:48,398 --> 00:41:50,036
then what the fuck is Donny doing here?

508
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,570
Seriously, the guy's just gonna go and kick it,

509
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:55,583
while somebody else screws his chick?

510
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,175
Nobody's that big of a dweeb.

511
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,619
- He's right.

512
00:42:04,681 --> 00:42:06,661
Holy shit, I could--

513
00:42:06,716 --> 00:42:09,162
We could say that I'm Heather's boyfriend.

514
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:10,493
<i>You know'?</i>

515
00:42:12,922 --> 00:42:14,424
That's good, right?

516
00:42:19,529 --> 00:42:21,475
- Hey?
- Hey.

517
00:42:21,531 --> 00:42:24,910
- What're you doing?
- Homework.

518
00:42:24,968 --> 00:42:26,106
No shit.

519
00:42:27,103 --> 00:42:29,549
Well, I'm over at Lisa's house,

520
00:42:29,606 --> 00:42:33,952
and that Ali chick is down here.

521
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,753
- I think she wants you.
- What are you taking about?

522
00:42:38,915 --> 00:42:40,189
<i>Hold on.</i>

523
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,755
Hey Bob, what's going on?

524
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,764
Hey!

525
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:47,493
You're not pissed off?

526
00:42:47,557 --> 00:42:51,130
No, I liked it, actually.
I've been thinking about it.

527
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,639
Maybe we could get together.

528
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:56,109
We could take my 5.0 out
and get ballistic or something.

529
00:43:02,172 --> 00:43:03,412
What's up?

530
00:43:03,473 --> 00:43:05,578
Marty, what's with this shit?

531
00:43:05,642 --> 00:43:07,588
I don't know. I guess she digs you.

532
00:43:07,644 --> 00:43:11,057
You got me jealous over here. She's fuckin' fine.

533
00:43:14,184 --> 00:43:16,164
Hey, you're there with fuckface?

534
00:43:18,021 --> 00:43:21,628
- Yeah.
- Oh. Sick.

535
00:43:23,293 --> 00:43:26,467
Okay, we do it and just roll the body into the canal.

536
00:43:26,529 --> 00:43:28,236
That's out by the Glades.

537
00:43:28,298 --> 00:43:30,278
The gators will eat his ass for lunch.

538
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:31,277
Here.

539
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:34,042
What are you giving me that for?

540
00:43:34,104 --> 00:43:35,811
You're in the best position to do it.

541
00:43:35,872 --> 00:43:37,852
You fuck him, then right when he's gonna come,

542
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:39,944
- you blow his brains out.
- Oh, shit.

543
00:43:40,009 --> 00:43:42,990
- That's cool.
- You're the one that wants him dead.

544
00:43:43,046 --> 00:43:44,957
You want him dead too.

545
00:43:45,014 --> 00:43:46,789
It's too risky if I do it.

546
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:49,023
I'd have to follow him. He might hear me coming.

547
00:43:51,287 --> 00:43:53,289
Here, take it.

548
00:43:53,356 --> 00:43:54,892
I'll be close by.

549
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:56,665
You shoot him, we'll ditch the body.

550
00:43:58,027 --> 00:44:00,234
All right, fuck it. Let's go!

551
00:44:21,885 --> 00:44:24,058
Hey, Bobby. I'm Heather's girl--

552
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,497
boyfriend... Fuck!

553
00:44:26,556 --> 00:44:29,435
Hey Don-- uh, Bobby--

554
00:44:29,492 --> 00:44:33,167
I'm Donny, this is Heather-- I'm-- I'm her boyfriend.

555
00:44:33,229 --> 00:44:34,207
Yeah.

556
00:44:34,264 --> 00:44:35,334
- That's good?
- Yeah.

557
00:44:35,398 --> 00:44:37,173
I was thinking we'd go out to Weston

558
00:44:37,233 --> 00:44:38,940
and mess around in those new developments

559
00:44:39,002 --> 00:44:40,845
and dog out my 5.0 or some shit.

560
00:44:40,904 --> 00:44:42,975
I'll give these two a ride back.

561
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:46,611
Wait a second, you're not coming?

562
00:44:46,676 --> 00:44:50,021
No, man. I'm fucking worked.

563
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:51,820
What about her?

564
00:44:51,881 --> 00:44:54,828
- I'm coming with you.
- No, man!

565
00:44:54,884 --> 00:44:57,524
I don't want your bitch coming along with us.

566
00:44:57,587 --> 00:44:59,863
Come on, Bobby. She's my homie.

567
00:44:59,923 --> 00:45:02,529
I haven't seen her in a long time and...

568
00:45:02,592 --> 00:45:05,300
we need to talk about some shit
on the way out anyway.

569
00:45:07,096 --> 00:45:08,268
What?

570
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:10,004
Hey, Bobby.

571
00:45:10,066 --> 00:45:15,311
I'm Donny, this is Heather. I'm fucking her.

572
00:45:17,574 --> 00:45:19,850
Okay, whatever, I'm driving.

573
00:45:32,989 --> 00:45:34,627
Goodbye, asshole.

574
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:42,938
You don't want to dog it out some more?

575
00:45:42,999 --> 00:45:47,573
- I mean, it is a 5.0.
- This ain't a 5.0, bitch.

576
00:45:49,005 --> 00:45:52,509
How about I dog you out? Huh?

577
00:45:55,111 --> 00:45:57,990
What the fuck did we come
all the way out here for, then?

578
00:46:01,251 --> 00:46:02,423
Fuck!

579
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:07,900
How about you give me a fucking blow job, now?

580
00:46:10,293 --> 00:46:12,239
What are you fucking bitches talking about?

581
00:46:13,997 --> 00:46:16,068
I'm going for a walk.

582
00:46:19,269 --> 00:46:22,307
Shit, you got a fuckin' irritating laugh, bitch.

583
00:47:12,255 --> 00:47:15,930
- ...Miss Tennessee.

584
00:47:22,999 --> 00:47:26,139
- So, is he dead?
- Nope, Lisa chickened out.

585
00:47:26,202 --> 00:47:27,146
Fuck I did.

586
00:47:27,203 --> 00:47:31,652
Yo, Marty, check out Miss Texas.
She's <i>so</i> fuckin' hot!

587
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,114
- You couldn't do it?
- No, I just thought of something.

588
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,786
On "Homicide" they can take a bullet out of the body

589
00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:41,328
and trace it back to the murder weapon.

590
00:47:41,384 --> 00:47:43,887
If I use my mom's gun, they can find out I did it.

591
00:47:43,953 --> 00:47:46,399
- So then toss it!
- Toss what?

592
00:47:46,456 --> 00:47:48,993
The gun, into the ocean, and
then they can't trace the bullet.

593
00:47:49,058 --> 00:47:52,130
I can't do that. My ma'd kill me.

594
00:47:52,195 --> 00:47:53,902
You're bullshit too, bitch.

595
00:47:53,963 --> 00:47:56,273
- I am not.
- Are so.

596
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:59,142
I think you're all fuckin' bullshit.

597
00:48:06,576 --> 00:48:08,988
You guys need professional help.

598
00:48:11,214 --> 00:48:12,921
Shit.

599
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:25,501
What's this shit?

600
00:48:25,561 --> 00:48:28,633
- I thought you were professionals.
- We are fuckin' professionals.

601
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:31,110
Why are you giving us shit we can't use?

602
00:48:51,654 --> 00:48:54,260
- Who is it?
- Some girl named Ali.

603
00:48:54,323 --> 00:48:55,825
Ali?

604
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:57,200
Hey, Ali. What's up?

605
00:48:58,861 --> 00:49:01,467
Sure as hell don't sound like a sanctioned hit.

606
00:49:04,834 --> 00:49:06,814
You can come over to talk about it,

607
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:08,815
but nothing's set in stone, all right?

608
00:49:10,106 --> 00:49:11,380
All right, cool.

609
00:49:46,142 --> 00:49:49,180
- Hey, it's me.
- What do you want?

610
00:49:49,245 --> 00:49:51,156
Derek, I need you for something big.

611
00:49:51,214 --> 00:49:54,457
- My truck's broken.
- Fuck your truck, I need you.

612
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:57,798
Then I need a ride.

613
00:50:04,761 --> 00:50:06,638
Come on, come on.

614
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,852
- You're in, dude?
- Let's go.

615
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:23,252
Hey, I'm Heather.

616
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,756
You wanna hit this?

617
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:39,834
So what do you do, man? What's your thing?

618
00:50:39,896 --> 00:50:41,273
What do you do?

619
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,777
- I do "Combat."
- Oh shit, "Combat"?

620
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:47,610
I fuckin' love combat. I like to drop acid and play.

621
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:51,447
That's cool.

622
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,919
So. You got a place to play at?

623
00:50:53,976 --> 00:50:58,254
Yeah, DNA Comics.
Across the street from Lisa's house.

624
00:50:58,314 --> 00:51:01,818
- Got any acid?
- Yeah I got some acid, bro'.

625
00:51:07,123 --> 00:51:08,659
<i>Open...</i> aaah.

626
00:51:09,725 --> 00:51:10,863
Here you go, man.

627
00:51:15,164 --> 00:51:17,440
All right. Take us to DNA, Heather.

628
00:51:27,143 --> 00:51:29,419
- Blasted!
- Wasted!

629
00:51:29,478 --> 00:51:31,116
Busted!

630
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:32,887
I think these guys have been experimenting

631
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:34,724
with some controlled substances.

632
00:51:34,784 --> 00:51:36,058
You aren't just whistling dixie.

633
00:51:36,118 --> 00:51:39,122
Come on, get the fuck out of the way.

634
00:51:39,188 --> 00:51:41,600
Big floppy donkey dick bully.

635
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:45,331
Choose your fighter.

636
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:47,704
Fight to the death.

637
00:52:00,343 --> 00:52:02,846
- You're Marty, right?
- Yeah.

638
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:04,414
I've watched you surf North Beach.

639
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,754
No shit?

640
00:52:05,815 --> 00:52:07,761
I like to rollerblade down there a lot.

641
00:52:08,851 --> 00:52:11,127
Look like you get a good workout from rollerblading.

642
00:52:11,187 --> 00:52:12,257
Thanks.

643
00:52:13,322 --> 00:52:14,665
Marty?

644
00:52:14,724 --> 00:52:16,795
You gotta get back to work.

645
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:18,338
I'll be there in a minute, man.

646
00:52:20,129 --> 00:52:22,541
I've never rollerbladed before.

647
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:26,307
We'll go sometime. I'll teach you.

648
00:52:29,038 --> 00:52:31,075
Here, let me give you my number.

649
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,175
Please do.

650
00:52:33,242 --> 00:52:36,223
What about your chick at home, man?

651
00:52:36,279 --> 00:52:38,281
That fat bitch with your baby?

652
00:52:40,016 --> 00:52:41,256
I mean it's--

653
00:52:45,187 --> 00:52:48,259
Well I guess I should be going now. Bye.

654
00:52:52,762 --> 00:52:54,571
I work right here.

655
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:59,010
This is my lunch break,
if you ever wanna come visit me.

656
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:01,740
What a cunt!

657
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:18,966
- Fatalize.
- Fatalize, fatalize.

658
00:53:23,426 --> 00:53:24,871
Fatalize.

659
00:53:24,927 --> 00:53:27,771
He's gonna hurl. Oh, shit.

660
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,003
I got it. I got it.

661
00:53:33,102 --> 00:53:37,107
Fucking A, man. You fucking fatalized the guy.

662
00:53:41,177 --> 00:53:43,919
What the fuck, man--
What the fuck does fatalize mean?

663
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,927
- Does it mean death?
- No dude, it's worse.

664
00:53:46,983 --> 00:53:49,725
Way worse, because you have to live, man.

665
00:53:49,785 --> 00:53:52,732
You have to live and you're like a fuckin' baby.

666
00:53:52,788 --> 00:53:54,825
Fuck, man!

667
00:53:56,325 --> 00:53:57,565
Shit!

668
00:53:59,095 --> 00:54:02,542
- Let's go help my cousin.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

669
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:04,577
Shit!

670
00:54:15,845 --> 00:54:18,587
Ew! Gross, yuck!

671
00:54:19,648 --> 00:54:20,888
Sorry.

672
00:54:22,651 --> 00:54:24,028
What's up, guys?

673
00:54:25,621 --> 00:54:26,793
Sorry.

674
00:54:26,856 --> 00:54:30,599
Go away. Go away right now.

675
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:34,998
Go away? Give me a kiss.

676
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:36,805
No, eeww!

677
00:54:36,866 --> 00:54:40,507
Jesus Christ, you guys
should have seen what Derek did.

678
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:43,778
He turned this guy into a baby.

679
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,820
Close your mouth when you eat, Jesus!

680
00:54:46,876 --> 00:54:48,753
Is this like a joke or something?

681
00:54:48,811 --> 00:54:51,291
No, it isn't a joke. I know this guy, he's in a gang.

682
00:54:51,347 --> 00:54:52,417
A hitman?

683
00:54:53,482 --> 00:54:54,358
No doubt.

684
00:55:19,708 --> 00:55:22,188
- Damn it!

685
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,334
I got it, Dad.

686
00:55:40,496 --> 00:55:44,205
Shit! Lay off the horn.
You're blasting my whole neighborhood.

687
00:55:45,334 --> 00:55:47,143
What's up, Ali?

688
00:55:47,203 --> 00:55:48,147
Nothing.

689
00:55:48,204 --> 00:55:51,276
We need to know if you can
get those guns for us, man.

690
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,786
You need to give me a little time.

691
00:55:53,843 --> 00:55:56,016
<i>Can' t just snap your fingers and shit.</i>

692
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:00,185
- Guns are hard to come by.
- I can get you some money.

693
00:56:00,249 --> 00:56:02,889
Oh yeah? Whose piggy bank are you gonna rob?

694
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:07,156
Come on, you know you can trust us.

695
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,801
Why do it with a gun?

696
00:56:12,862 --> 00:56:14,808
It just seemed like the easy way to do it.

697
00:56:14,864 --> 00:56:18,209
You need to chill out
and plan this out a little better.

698
00:56:18,267 --> 00:56:19,575
No, I wanna do it now.

699
00:56:19,635 --> 00:56:21,740
God damn it, I want the son of a bitch dead.

700
00:56:21,804 --> 00:56:23,442
I want his sorry ass dead tonight.

701
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:25,747
Do you understand me?

702
00:56:27,576 --> 00:56:29,180
<i>All right, look...</i>

703
00:56:29,245 --> 00:56:31,225
maybe I can help you, but I don't know.

704
00:56:32,515 --> 00:56:34,791
First you guys need some weapons and shit.

705
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:37,126
You should think about planning this out better.

706
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:41,168
Then, when you get all that done,
then you can come see me.

707
00:56:41,223 --> 00:56:43,567
I have a window around the rear.

708
00:56:43,626 --> 00:56:45,936
Just come by and knock a little lightly.

709
00:56:45,995 --> 00:56:47,565
I'll be there.

710
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:50,839
Like a signal, right? Like in Tom Sawyer.

711
00:56:56,805 --> 00:57:00,014
My normal suppliers, they won't
help out with this shit.

712
00:57:00,075 --> 00:57:02,715
Maybe I'll just come and supervise, I don't know.

713
00:57:02,778 --> 00:57:04,883
But either way, you got a weapons problem.

714
00:57:09,952 --> 00:57:13,399
I swear to God, I can't wait
to stab that motherfucker.

715
00:57:13,455 --> 00:57:16,368
Slit his throat and bleed him like a pig.

716
00:57:16,425 --> 00:57:18,268
I'm gonna slice his guts open,

717
00:57:18,327 --> 00:57:20,466
spill his intestines out on the dirt,

718
00:57:20,529 --> 00:57:22,099
beat him in the head with a baseball bat

719
00:57:22,164 --> 00:57:23,643
until his eyeballs fall out.

720
00:57:25,501 --> 00:57:28,880
If you won't do it, I'll do it.
I'll cut the fucker for you.

721
00:57:28,938 --> 00:57:32,181
I'll do it. I'll fuckin'-- I'll kill-- I'll--

722
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:34,187
I'll do it if you won't do it.

723
00:57:42,952 --> 00:57:45,694
So weird. This shit's so weird.

724
00:57:51,894 --> 00:57:54,534
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey, Aunt Mo.

725
00:57:54,597 --> 00:57:58,204
Still here, Ali?
Don't you have a baby to take care of?

726
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:01,578
- She's on her way back.
- She should get her stuff and go, then.

727
00:58:03,072 --> 00:58:04,517
You guys don't work.

728
00:58:04,573 --> 00:58:07,247
You don't go to school, you don't do anything.

729
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:10,950
All you do is lay around and drive your cars,

730
00:58:11,013 --> 00:58:12,890
and eat us out of house and home.

731
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:14,689
You know how that makes me feel?

732
00:58:17,052 --> 00:58:19,623
- Mad!

733
00:58:26,595 --> 00:58:28,506
The fuck are we gonna do now, man?

734
00:58:28,564 --> 00:58:30,043
Just calm the fuck down.

735
00:58:36,705 --> 00:58:41,154
- Ow, my butt!
- Fuck, Ali. This sucks.

736
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,621
Don't worry about it.

737
00:58:42,678 --> 00:58:45,090
We'll park around the corner until Lisa's mom leaves.

738
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:50,054
You're not with Ali, are you?

739
00:58:51,253 --> 00:58:55,360
- Not unless I lose some weight.
- You've always had common sense.

740
00:58:57,059 --> 00:58:59,972
I'm glad to see you hanging out with Lisa.

741
00:59:01,597 --> 00:59:03,372
I'm surprised, but glad.

742
00:59:05,567 --> 00:59:06,978
You like her friends?

743
00:59:09,405 --> 00:59:10,406
I don't know.

744
00:59:11,607 --> 00:59:15,282
I mean, they get a little crazy, sometimes, but...

745
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:18,484
I'm just hanging out.

746
00:59:18,547 --> 00:59:19,423
Good.

747
00:59:20,916 --> 00:59:24,159
You know, when we lived in the Bronx,
at least we had a family.

748
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,097
Family kept things tight and safe.

749
00:59:28,157 --> 00:59:33,038
Down here in Florida, nobody's tight.
Everybody's just... whatever.

750
00:59:34,396 --> 00:59:37,275
Don't Ali's parents wonder where she is?

751
00:59:38,334 --> 00:59:39,312
I don't know.

752
00:59:40,736 --> 00:59:43,945
I'm going over to your mother's, play some cards.

753
00:59:53,749 --> 00:59:54,989
What?

754
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,529
What's the matter?

755
00:59:56,585 --> 01:00:00,658
Nothing, I love you, Ali. I truly love you.

756
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:02,794
I do too, Ali.

757
01:00:07,262 --> 01:00:10,004
We're gonna be okay, guys, you know?

758
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:12,841
We're gonna get this shit behind us and...

759
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:15,711
we're gonna be back in time in Palm Bay,

760
01:00:15,771 --> 01:00:18,377
for Denny's birthday at his mom's house.

761
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,717
Shit, I never knew nobody who killed somebody.

762
01:00:24,113 --> 01:00:25,456
Me neither.

763
01:00:26,548 --> 01:00:30,052
Just my grandpa. I never knew him.

764
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:31,598
No way?

765
01:00:31,653 --> 01:00:34,691
Yeah. My grandpa was a bad drunk.

766
01:00:34,757 --> 01:00:36,498
Really bad.

767
01:00:37,593 --> 01:00:42,838
He'd rape anyone dumb enough to walk by his room.

768
01:00:42,898 --> 01:00:47,005
One night... he got...

769
01:00:47,069 --> 01:00:50,573
really pissed at my grandma and
he took a claw hammer to her face.

770
01:00:53,509 --> 01:00:58,891
After that, he locked himself up with her...

771
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:01,427
in his room for two whole days...

772
01:01:01,483 --> 01:01:06,557
and he kept drinking and having sex
with her after she was dead.

773
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:10,602
My mom was in the house the whole time.

774
01:01:10,659 --> 01:01:14,334
- Fuck.
- She was only 15.

775
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:21,072
Holy shit.

776
01:01:21,136 --> 01:01:23,776
You know, it really messed with her head.

777
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:29,812
After that, she only hung out with guys
who beat the hell out of her.

778
01:01:29,878 --> 01:01:32,119
And then, when I was little,

779
01:01:32,181 --> 01:01:34,491
she'd get drunk and she'd drag me and my brother

780
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:37,224
out of bed at four in the morning and...

781
01:01:37,286 --> 01:01:41,098
she had all the news clippings about my grandpa...

782
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:45,036
and she'd read them over and over again.

783
01:01:45,093 --> 01:01:49,041
I knew every word before kindergarten.

784
01:01:50,132 --> 01:01:52,203
I think that's how I learned to read.

785
01:01:56,772 --> 01:01:59,252
She's gone. We should go.

786
01:02:00,242 --> 01:02:03,485
That chick Ali gave me a blow job, last night.

787
01:02:03,545 --> 01:02:07,755
- And I fucked her.
- Cool.

788
01:02:07,816 --> 01:02:09,659
She called again.

789
01:02:09,718 --> 01:02:11,891
Says you all are going back out to Weston.

790
01:02:13,455 --> 01:02:14,297
Marty?

791
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:16,836
Yeah man, that's the plan.

792
01:02:16,892 --> 01:02:18,132
Are you going out?

793
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:25,068
Hey, man? You're my best friend.

794
01:02:26,134 --> 01:02:27,112
Right?

795
01:02:28,237 --> 01:02:29,215
Yeah.

796
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:52,162
Okay, we're picking Marty up in 45 minutes.

797
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:53,900
Derek, what's up with the baseball bat?

798
01:02:56,431 --> 01:02:58,377
Come on, we need more weapons.

799
01:03:00,502 --> 01:03:03,506
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

800
01:03:03,572 --> 01:03:07,577
- My ma said something?
- No, it's just--

801
01:03:08,677 --> 01:03:11,089
Never mind, everything's okay.

802
01:03:17,352 --> 01:03:21,300
My back hurts. I have a tension backache.

803
01:03:21,356 --> 01:03:23,893
Derek, will you give me a massage?

804
01:03:29,464 --> 01:03:32,911
Me too, my back hurts too. I want a massage.

805
01:03:32,968 --> 01:03:34,208
Harder.

806
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:36,647
- Like that?
- Hmmm!

807
01:03:44,179 --> 01:03:45,487
Watch it!

808
01:03:48,884 --> 01:03:50,022
I guess I'll--

809
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:53,994
Okay, I guess I'll go do something about the bats.

810
01:03:54,056 --> 01:03:55,501
Good idea.

811
01:04:02,064 --> 01:04:04,305
Okay, there's one thing left to do.

812
01:04:04,366 --> 01:04:07,973
- What's that?
- The hitman needs a ride.

813
01:04:16,678 --> 01:04:18,624
Where are you going tonight, Bob?

814
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,819
Going out with my friend.

815
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:24,528
Need any money?

816
01:04:24,586 --> 01:04:26,566
No Dad. I'm cool, thanks.

817
01:04:44,539 --> 01:04:46,678
Marty, could I use your bathroom?

818
01:04:46,742 --> 01:04:48,380
- Number one or two?
- One.

819
01:04:48,443 --> 01:04:49,888
Just go in the alley.

820
01:04:52,147 --> 01:04:53,956
- What's up, man?
- <i>How's</i> it going?

821
01:04:54,016 --> 01:04:58,590
CMF, CMF, what the fuck? What does that mean, CMF?

822
01:04:58,654 --> 01:05:00,565
Didn't we already tell him what it means?

823
01:05:00,622 --> 01:05:01,896
What's with this guy?

824
01:05:01,957 --> 01:05:04,301
- What does it mean?
- It means Crazy MotherFucker.

825
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:06,100
It's like "The Godfather"...

826
01:05:06,161 --> 01:05:08,300
- A division of the Davy Boyz.
- Oh, shit!

827
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:12,243
Fuckin' Godfather, Crazy MotherFuckers. Holy shit!

828
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,870
Crazy MotherFuckers, huh?

829
01:05:13,935 --> 01:05:15,608
- Holy shit!
- Hey, man?

830
01:05:15,671 --> 01:05:18,174
- Think this is heavy enough?
- To kill a guy?

831
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,119
- Yeah.
- Maybe, if you hit him right.

832
01:05:21,176 --> 01:05:22,587
You mean in the back of the head or some shit?

833
01:05:22,644 --> 01:05:25,181
It don't matter. You just gotta hit him hard enough.

834
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,851
Yeah, I guess that's the key.

835
01:05:26,915 --> 01:05:27,950
Yeah.

836
01:05:28,016 --> 01:05:31,225
You can't just smack the motherfucker,
you've got to really wack him!

837
01:05:31,286 --> 01:05:33,129
It's not like in a fight and you're mad at him.

838
01:05:33,188 --> 01:05:36,601
You're not trying to hurt him.
You're trying to kill him.

839
01:05:37,659 --> 01:05:38,899
I got something else.

840
01:05:40,729 --> 01:05:42,003
See, that's cool!

841
01:05:42,064 --> 01:05:43,372
It's Marty, right?

842
01:05:43,432 --> 01:05:44,877
- Yo!
- Yeah.

843
01:05:44,933 --> 01:05:47,914
What about this shit? This shit is good enough?

844
01:05:47,969 --> 01:05:49,676
Right here, right here.

845
01:05:51,506 --> 01:05:53,884
What the fuck for? You're gonna play baseball?

846
01:05:53,942 --> 01:05:56,650
- No!
- Then why the fuck you got a bat?

847
01:05:56,712 --> 01:05:58,385
What are you gonna do with that?

848
01:05:58,447 --> 01:06:00,586
- For the guy!
- What guy?

849
01:06:00,649 --> 01:06:01,627
Bobby Kent!

850
01:06:01,683 --> 01:06:03,754
- What about Bobby Kent?
- The guy we're going to kill!

851
01:06:03,819 --> 01:06:07,426
Is this bat good enough to ram his fuckin' head in?

852
01:06:07,489 --> 01:06:09,491
- I don't know, man.
- How about this knife?

853
01:06:09,558 --> 01:06:11,936
This knife is good, right?
I tried to sharpen it but--

854
01:06:11,993 --> 01:06:15,566
- I don't know, man!
- All right, fuck!

855
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:18,201
Are we going just to fight this guy,

856
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:19,836
or are we gonna kill him?

857
01:06:19,901 --> 01:06:22,381
I want him dead tonight and
I don't want any bullshit!

858
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:28,444
Yeah, I mean, this is
the son of a bitch that raped Ali.

859
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:31,047
- He fuckin' raped her!
- Yeah, just think about it.

860
01:06:31,113 --> 01:06:33,059
He won't even let Marty have a life.

861
01:06:33,115 --> 01:06:35,789
He beats him every time he does
something Bobby doesn't like.

862
01:06:35,851 --> 01:06:36,727
Do you fuckin' mind?

863
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:38,890
He won't even let him see his own family.

864
01:06:40,188 --> 01:06:41,667
That sucks.

865
01:06:43,425 --> 01:06:44,904
This guy deserves to die.

866
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,770
He does deserve it. Agreed.

867
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:49,570
So we're not just gonna scare him.

868
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,907
- We're gonna kill him?
- We're gonna kill him!

869
01:06:53,368 --> 01:06:55,314
I want this motherfucker dead, you understand me?

870
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:58,442
I want this motherfucker dead.

871
01:06:58,507 --> 01:07:02,683
♪ Let's fuckin' kill him, fuckin' kill him! ♪

872
01:07:02,744 --> 01:07:05,748
Dead! Let's kill the motherfucker.

873
01:07:05,814 --> 01:07:08,727
- Dead! Dead! Dead!
- Dead.

874
01:07:08,784 --> 01:07:10,889
Dead! We're gonna kill this fucker.

875
01:07:10,952 --> 01:07:12,454
Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead--

876
01:07:12,521 --> 01:07:15,434
Oh, shit, sorry. Go ahead. I'm gonna fuckin' lose it.

877
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:16,434
Go ahead.

878
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:21,364
You people need to understand some shit here.

879
01:07:21,429 --> 01:07:22,499
What?

880
01:07:22,564 --> 01:07:23,838
This isn't a game.

881
01:07:23,899 --> 01:07:25,640
We're not a bunch of kids playing make believe.

882
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,306
- Who says we're playing?
- Come down, all right?

883
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:30,748
You guys got to understand that me and my people,

884
01:07:30,806 --> 01:07:32,251
we're what you call serious people.

885
01:07:32,307 --> 01:07:34,344
And you do know what I mean when I say serious.

886
01:07:34,409 --> 01:07:36,446
- We understand what you--
- What does it mean?

887
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:39,014
- Enlighten me.
- It means you ain't playing.

888
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,560
I said from the beginning that I'd kill this dude.

889
01:07:41,616 --> 01:07:43,323
I was the first one to say it.

890
01:07:43,385 --> 01:07:45,888
So don't fuckin' treat me like I'm a kid, okay?

891
01:07:46,955 --> 01:07:48,025
What about you?

892
01:07:48,089 --> 01:07:51,229
This guy? Dude, this fuckin' kid is cold, man.

893
01:07:51,293 --> 01:07:54,069
I've been hangin' out with him
for only a couple days,

894
01:07:54,129 --> 01:07:57,633
I've seen this guy do shit you wouldn't believe.

895
01:07:58,934 --> 01:08:00,242
He's cold.

896
01:08:00,302 --> 01:08:02,077
All right, that's good.

897
01:08:03,171 --> 01:08:05,378
- Yeah, that's real good.

898
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,748
- Hi, Mom!
- Hey, Loverbug.

899
01:08:06,808 --> 01:08:08,185
What are you kids doing tonight?

900
01:08:08,243 --> 01:08:09,984
Probably going to the movies.

901
01:08:10,045 --> 01:08:12,252
- Drive safe, okay?
- I will.

902
01:08:13,615 --> 01:08:15,390
Be careful with my car, honey.

903
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:16,793
Okay, Mom.

904
01:08:38,306 --> 01:08:39,751
What's going on, man?

905
01:08:39,808 --> 01:08:42,414
You tell me, dude. Who are these fuckin' assholes?

906
01:08:42,477 --> 01:08:45,253
Just some fuckin' dudes
Ali brought down from Palm Bay.

907
01:08:45,313 --> 01:08:48,055
Some dudes. What the fuck, man?

908
01:08:48,116 --> 01:08:50,858
I thought you said she wanted to fuck me.

909
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:52,626
She does, dude. That's the fuck she wants.

910
01:08:52,687 --> 01:08:53,995
That's all she's been talking about.

911
01:08:54,055 --> 01:08:55,693
We're just gonna dog out the rides.

912
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:57,896
See if the Mustang can take my old lady's ride.

913
01:08:59,561 --> 01:09:01,404
That's fuckin' stupid.

914
01:09:01,463 --> 01:09:03,875
What kind of race is that, man?

915
01:09:03,932 --> 01:09:06,606
Why don't you chill, Bobby? Goddamn, dude.

916
01:09:06,668 --> 01:09:10,047
We'll go out to the dunes
where you guys were last time.

917
01:09:10,105 --> 01:09:12,085
You didn't do <i>so</i> bad then, did you?

918
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:13,084
Huh?

919
01:09:14,409 --> 01:09:15,717
All right, man.

920
01:09:25,053 --> 01:09:28,500
Get in the back, bitch.
I'm driving this piece of shit.

921
01:09:31,393 --> 01:09:34,897
Damn. Keep you in mind.

922
01:09:39,534 --> 01:09:41,639
Show me how to shift this thing.

923
01:09:44,272 --> 01:09:48,448
- You're <i>so</i> hot!
- I'm not hot, baby, I'm just big.

924
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:54,816
That guy's an asshole to be driving like that.

925
01:09:54,883 --> 01:09:57,591
Tell me about it. We've got to kill that fucker.

926
01:09:58,853 --> 01:10:03,063
- All right, I love these dudes.
- I love them too, man.

927
01:10:03,124 --> 01:10:05,832
They're <i>so</i> good. Did you see them
when they were down here?

928
01:10:05,894 --> 01:10:07,771
Fuck yeah, man. You?

929
01:10:09,164 --> 01:10:13,169
I went down to the show with my friend
and we got <i>so</i> fucked up.

930
01:10:13,234 --> 01:10:15,771
So did the whole fuckin' crowd, man.

931
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:19,546
They had this fat Chinese guy on stage with them--

932
01:10:19,607 --> 01:10:21,245
Buddha dude! Buddha dude!

933
01:10:21,309 --> 01:10:24,051
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah.
- He was a fuckin' Buddha dude!

934
01:10:24,112 --> 01:10:28,822
He had this huge marijuana leaf
on his stomach, you know?

935
01:10:28,883 --> 01:10:32,023
Yeah, man. Then they played this one song...

936
01:10:32,087 --> 01:10:34,761
and the whole fuckin' <i>crowd</i> lit up at once.

937
01:10:34,823 --> 01:10:37,736
Marijuana, just fuckin' smoking, everybody.

938
01:10:37,792 --> 01:10:39,430
I lit up too.

939
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:43,206
- Right on.
- We might as well get high.

940
01:10:47,268 --> 01:10:49,305
What did that dude mean earlier when he said

941
01:10:49,371 --> 01:10:51,612
he had seen you do some amazing shit?

942
01:10:51,673 --> 01:10:55,348
Me? I don't know what that dude thinks he saw me do.

943
01:10:55,410 --> 01:10:58,482
- Could be anything.
- Yeah but what exactly?

944
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:00,958
Did you do somebody or something?

945
01:11:01,016 --> 01:11:03,496
I kind of got down on a guy earlier today.

946
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:04,859
You killed him?

947
01:11:04,919 --> 01:11:07,798
No, it wasn't anything like that. It was at the mall.

948
01:11:09,491 --> 01:11:11,596
I put a little disciplinary action on him.

949
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:14,271
Disciplinary action.

950
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:16,365
I like that.

951
01:11:16,431 --> 01:11:18,604
You put some disciplinary action on him.

952
01:11:18,666 --> 01:11:19,838
Yeah.

953
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:28,146
What's your deal, man? Huh?

954
01:11:28,209 --> 01:11:32,385
- What?
- Why are you here?

955
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:40,397
<i>I am...</i>

956
01:11:42,323 --> 01:11:45,133
He's Heather's boyfriend. He's here with her.

957
01:11:45,193 --> 01:11:46,831
Yeah.

958
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:53,643
- You live in Palm Bay?
- Yep.

959
01:11:55,203 --> 01:11:57,012
So why-- I mean what's your--

960
01:11:58,073 --> 01:11:59,916
What's your deal? Why did you come down?

961
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:02,952
<i>L...</i>

962
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:06,183
I don't know.

963
01:12:07,482 --> 01:12:10,554
To see what a fine looking man I'm going out with.

964
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:12,427
- Yeah.

965
01:12:14,556 --> 01:12:17,765
- You call that going out?
- I don't know.

966
01:12:19,461 --> 01:12:21,668
I call it a fuckin' blow job.

967
01:12:22,897 --> 01:12:26,003
Damn fine blow job, but a blow job all the same.

968
01:12:26,067 --> 01:12:30,277
What do you mean by going out?
What the hell's your definition?

969
01:12:30,338 --> 01:12:33,410
I don't fuckin' know.
What's your name again, Feather?

970
01:12:33,475 --> 01:12:36,615
My name's not Feather, it's Heather.

971
01:12:37,745 --> 01:12:40,157
All right. Let me ask you a question, Heather.

972
01:12:40,215 --> 01:12:42,661
Are you a hooker here, like your friend?

973
01:12:42,717 --> 01:12:44,355
- Oh, shit.
- Shit.

974
01:12:48,156 --> 01:12:49,260
Huh?

975
01:12:49,324 --> 01:12:53,773
You know what? You better watch your mouth...

976
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:57,366
or my boyfriend will be real pissed at you.

977
01:12:58,867 --> 01:13:01,347
Who's that? Lonny back there?

978
01:13:01,402 --> 01:13:04,076
You're talking about Lonny in the back seat?

979
01:13:04,139 --> 01:13:06,176
He's gonna get mad at me and then what?

980
01:13:06,241 --> 01:13:09,120
What's he gonna do then?
What are you gonna do, Lonny?

981
01:13:10,645 --> 01:13:11,851
It's Donny, dude.

982
01:13:13,915 --> 01:13:16,293
It's definitely Donny.

983
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:18,763
Yeah, whatever. You know your girlfriend's a hooker?

984
01:13:19,921 --> 01:13:20,865
For real.

985
01:13:21,923 --> 01:13:25,234
That teen prostitution bust, two years back?

986
01:13:25,293 --> 01:13:28,467
They were 14, they got busted.

987
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,567
That was these two holes turning tricks

988
01:13:30,632 --> 01:13:32,805
for crusty old men at $100 a pop.

989
01:13:34,202 --> 01:13:35,510
For real.

990
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:39,108
Marty tells me you guys have turned
a few tricks yourselves.

991
01:13:41,943 --> 01:13:43,115
What?

992
01:13:44,479 --> 01:13:47,153
Is that what Marty Puccio said about me?

993
01:13:54,422 --> 01:13:57,232
So? We're gonna beat
the shit out of this guy or what?

994
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:02,936
I don't know, bro'. They say they want to kill him.

995
01:14:09,837 --> 01:14:13,114
- How do think it's gonna go down?
- You're talking to me?

996
01:14:13,174 --> 01:14:15,882
Yeah, we got what? You, me, Donny and Derek.

997
01:14:15,944 --> 01:14:17,287
Wait, who's Donny?

998
01:14:17,345 --> 01:14:19,382
Ali's boyfriend from Palm Bay.

999
01:14:19,447 --> 01:14:22,018
Geez! That guy's fuckin' retarded.

1000
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,996
No, he just gets high a lot.
He's as normal as you and me.

1001
01:14:25,053 --> 01:14:26,999
Shit, that may not be saying too much.

1002
01:14:28,389 --> 01:14:30,960
We brought you here 'cause
you're supposed to be the gangster,

1003
01:14:31,025 --> 01:14:33,505
- and the hitman and all that.
- Yeah.

1004
01:14:33,561 --> 01:14:35,563
- Well?
- Well?

1005
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:37,132
So, what do we do?

1006
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:39,644
We're gonna need a plan, like a signal.

1007
01:14:39,701 --> 01:14:42,079
The fuck you mean, like a signal?

1008
01:14:42,136 --> 01:14:45,310
You get the guy out here
telling you're gonna race cars,

1009
01:14:45,373 --> 01:14:47,182
but the real reason he's here is for the bitch.

1010
01:14:47,242 --> 01:14:50,052
- The bitch?
- He thinks he's gonna fuck Ali.

1011
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:53,320
We need to get Ali to lead him off somewhere,

1012
01:14:53,381 --> 01:14:54,917
and then we'll sneak up from behind.

1013
01:14:54,983 --> 01:14:57,520
- Then we give the signal.
- And then what?

1014
01:14:57,585 --> 01:14:58,893
Then we kill him.

1015
01:14:59,988 --> 01:15:02,992
- So, what's the signal?
- I don't know.

1016
01:15:03,057 --> 01:15:06,231
We'll have to wait 'til I get there,
<i>so</i> I can check out the scene.

1017
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:07,932
This has to be done right.

1018
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:16,849
Let's take a walk.

1019
01:15:18,539 --> 01:15:19,984
<i>Let's do it.</i>

1020
01:15:41,729 --> 01:15:43,299
He's gonna tell us what to do.

1021
01:15:43,364 --> 01:15:46,208
Yeah, I got a few ideas.

1022
01:15:46,267 --> 01:15:49,180
I can't believe we're doing this. My adrenaline's--

1023
01:15:49,237 --> 01:15:50,682
Shut the fuck up, Donny!

1024
01:15:50,738 --> 01:15:52,615
You shouldn't yell like that.

1025
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:55,621
It's not like someone's gonna hear us out here.

1026
01:15:55,677 --> 01:15:57,520
You know what? You shouldn't yell...

1027
01:15:57,578 --> 01:16:00,991
because someone could hear and
think someone's getting killed--

1028
01:16:01,049 --> 01:16:02,824
I'll keep that in mind, Heather.

1029
01:16:02,884 --> 01:16:04,591
Who else has a weapon?

1030
01:16:07,822 --> 01:16:09,199
You still got that knife?

1031
01:16:09,257 --> 01:16:10,702
- Yeah.
- So get it out!

1032
01:16:12,827 --> 01:16:14,306
Do you plan on doing anything?

1033
01:16:15,363 --> 01:16:16,706
Fuckin' right.

1034
01:16:17,965 --> 01:16:20,946
So what? What do you want us to do?

1035
01:16:21,002 --> 01:16:22,948
I don't know. What do you wanna do?

1036
01:16:23,004 --> 01:16:26,349
- I want this fucker dead now.
- I understand that.

1037
01:16:27,408 --> 01:16:28,944
Here's what I think we should do.

1038
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:32,014
We're gonna need a signal, <i>so</i> Heather...

1039
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,617
you walk down there like you're gonna talk to them.

1040
01:16:34,682 --> 01:16:37,891
When you see that everything's okay,
that he doesn't suspect shit...

1041
01:16:37,952 --> 01:16:41,195
then you yell out "Are there
any alligators down there?"

1042
01:16:41,255 --> 01:16:43,462
When we hear that, we'll know it's time.

1043
01:16:47,462 --> 01:16:49,840
- Alligators in where?
- In the canal.

1044
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,069
It's a signal.

1045
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:54,637
Just say something about alligators,
all right? Then we'll do him.

1046
01:16:54,702 --> 01:16:58,115
I say "alligators" and then you'll come.

1047
01:16:58,172 --> 01:16:59,981
Yeah, it's a signal.

1048
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:01,611
- You.
- Yeah.

1049
01:17:01,676 --> 01:17:04,179
Go down there like you're her boyfriend,
hold your hand or some shit.

1050
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:06,418
When you hear that signal, do it!

1051
01:17:06,481 --> 01:17:08,188
- Okay.
- So, go!

1052
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:09,455
All right!

1053
01:17:11,386 --> 01:17:13,764
- What do you want me to do?
- You back 'em up.

1054
01:17:17,759 --> 01:17:18,703
Go!

1055
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:21,673
We'll back them from up here, <i>so</i> he can't get away.

1056
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:36,950
Uh, yeah...

1057
01:17:37,011 --> 01:17:40,618
Are there any alligators in there?

1058
01:17:41,749 --> 01:17:42,887
What?

1059
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:45,760
She asked if there were any alligators.

1060
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:49,358
I don't know. Why don't you go
skinny-dip to find out?

1061
01:17:51,426 --> 01:17:53,702
I asked him if there were any alligators in there.

1062
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,209
Motherfucker!

1063
01:18:04,172 --> 01:18:05,480
God damn it!

1064
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:08,146
Marty!

1065
01:18:12,413 --> 01:18:13,653
Marty!

1066
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:26,199
Please Marty, please!

1067
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:28,900
Please, whatever I did, I'm sorry!

1068
01:18:28,963 --> 01:18:30,169
Just go!

1069
01:18:45,379 --> 01:18:47,120
He can't get away!

1070
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:49,320
Get him!

1071
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:07,744
Finish him! Go, go!

1072
01:19:19,747 --> 01:19:22,819
Turn your goddamn lights off, Ali!

1073
01:19:32,827 --> 01:19:34,272
- What do you want?
- Get out.

1074
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:37,068
Get fuckin' out!

1075
01:19:38,799 --> 01:19:40,073
Help me carry him.

1076
01:19:40,868 --> 01:19:43,007
Why are you standing around

1077
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,743
instead of doing what I tell you to do!?

1078
01:19:46,507 --> 01:19:48,783
- Is he dead?
- Shut up, Heather.

1079
01:19:48,843 --> 01:19:50,754
- Help me pick him up.
- Why?

1080
01:19:50,811 --> 01:19:53,018
Because we gotta get him out of sight, asshole!

1081
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,788
- Is he dead?
- The fucker's definitely dead.

1082
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:58,456
They just beat his head in with a baseball bat.

1083
01:19:58,519 --> 01:20:02,092
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I don't wanna get blood on my shirt.

1084
01:20:02,156 --> 01:20:04,432
We're not gonna hug him, asshole!

1085
01:20:05,993 --> 01:20:07,836
Grab his feet, I'll grab his arms.

1086
01:20:11,966 --> 01:20:13,070
What do you wanna do with him?

1087
01:20:13,134 --> 01:20:15,045
Throw him in the canal. The gators will get him.

1088
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:17,878
By the time anyone gets here,
there'll be nothing left to find.

1089
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:19,179
Cool.

1090
01:20:20,408 --> 01:20:21,443
Lift!

1091
01:20:23,077 --> 01:20:25,956
- Can we go?
- Just shut up!

1092
01:20:27,982 --> 01:20:29,552
- Now what, asshole?
- What?

1093
01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:31,290
This is not too good.

1094
01:20:34,488 --> 01:20:36,126
Why isn't he dead?

1095
01:20:36,190 --> 01:20:40,536
Just throw him in the water, man.
This kid isn't gonna swim.

1096
01:20:47,835 --> 01:20:49,178
Is he dead yet?

1097
01:20:50,404 --> 01:20:51,439
Getting there.

1098
01:21:01,215 --> 01:21:02,660
Take me home now.

1099
01:21:04,785 --> 01:21:06,059
Where's everybody going?

1100
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,793
Where do you think we're going, Disneyland?

1101
01:21:07,855 --> 01:21:09,926
- We're going home!
- Bullshit!

1102
01:21:09,991 --> 01:21:13,097
Let me tell you. We better get our alibis straight.

1103
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:16,471
- I ain't having this pinned on me!
- Right, but we gotta leave

1104
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:17,736
before someone finds us.

1105
01:21:17,798 --> 01:21:19,800
We'll go to the mall near my house

1106
01:21:19,867 --> 01:21:22,143
and chill out there and get our stories straight.

1107
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:26,810
Marty, you're okay?

1108
01:21:51,499 --> 01:21:54,002
That shit didn't go down right. People weren't cool!

1109
01:21:54,068 --> 01:21:56,412
We can't go to the mall.

1110
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:58,882
There's too many kids hanging out there.

1111
01:21:58,939 --> 01:22:00,714
How about North Beach?

1112
01:22:00,775 --> 01:22:03,016
We chill out and get our shit
together about the alibi.

1113
01:22:03,077 --> 01:22:04,351
You better tell them.

1114
01:22:08,849 --> 01:22:10,260
North Beach.

1115
01:22:22,029 --> 01:22:24,134
You shouldn't feel bad, Ali.

1116
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:26,870
He deserved to die.

1117
01:22:28,369 --> 01:22:31,179
He would have hurt you, or your baby.

1118
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:34,284
What do you mean?

1119
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:38,481
I don't know. I don't know, I--

1120
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:44,962
I just don't think you should have
a guilt trip or something.

1121
01:22:45,019 --> 01:22:45,963
No?

1122
01:22:56,464 --> 01:22:58,535
It smells like blood.

1123
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:00,579
What? You're crazy. I don't smell anything.

1124
01:23:00,634 --> 01:23:02,409
It smells like blood. You can smell it.

1125
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:04,450
I don't smell it.

1126
01:23:04,505 --> 01:23:07,486
Lisa says she smells blood, then she smells blood.

1127
01:23:07,541 --> 01:23:08,611
People are different.

1128
01:23:09,677 --> 01:23:11,247
It fucking stinks.

1129
01:23:11,312 --> 01:23:13,258
What does blood smell like, anyway?

1130
01:23:15,049 --> 01:23:19,122
I don't know. But it reeks!

1131
01:23:19,186 --> 01:23:20,221
Lisa?

1132
01:23:22,757 --> 01:23:23,963
What is it, baby?

1133
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:27,795
I forgot the sheath to my diving knife.

1134
01:23:27,862 --> 01:23:30,308
No, you put it behind the bushes, I saw you.

1135
01:23:30,364 --> 01:23:31,365
Yeah.

1136
01:23:33,334 --> 01:23:35,678
- You didn't get it?
- No.

1137
01:23:37,271 --> 01:23:40,718
- I can't go back.
- You have to.

1138
01:23:40,775 --> 01:23:43,153
Marty, they can find the fingerprints.

1139
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:45,713
But there can be people there by now.

1140
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:47,487
Jesus fuckin' Christ, what now?

1141
01:23:47,548 --> 01:23:50,722
I got to go back. I left my sheath back there.

1142
01:23:50,785 --> 01:23:52,458
We're gonna have to go back anyway.

1143
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:53,828
We didn't cover the tire tracks,

1144
01:23:53,888 --> 01:23:55,424
people might have left other shit out there.

1145
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:57,332
We just freaked! We left too fast.

1146
01:23:57,391 --> 01:24:01,703
- I can't go back there.
- We're not asking you.

1147
01:24:01,762 --> 01:24:02,740
Ali?

1148
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:12,783
You were his best friend.
You'll be the number one suspect.

1149
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:16,652
That doesn't make sense.
I should be the last they suspect.

1150
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:20,180
You're not a cop! You don't know how they think.

1151
01:24:20,247 --> 01:24:24,252
They suspect you even if you look
like the most innocent person.

1152
01:24:24,318 --> 01:24:28,789
The more innocent you seem, the more
they get off on fucking with you.

1153
01:24:28,856 --> 01:24:30,335
They get off on that shit.

1154
01:24:34,094 --> 01:24:35,095
We're here.

1155
01:24:37,431 --> 01:24:39,536
- Do you think there's--
- Shhh!

1156
01:24:45,472 --> 01:24:46,450
Ready?

1157
01:24:48,209 --> 01:24:49,620
Let's make this shit fast.

1158
01:24:49,677 --> 01:24:53,921
Police planes stealth around here,
looking for raves and vandals.

1159
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:03,364
- Sorry.

1160
01:25:16,937 --> 01:25:18,939
Jesus, man! Don't do that.

1161
01:25:19,006 --> 01:25:21,145
- Any luck?
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

1162
01:25:21,208 --> 01:25:22,812
We need to see if he's still there.

1163
01:25:23,878 --> 01:25:26,950
- What the fuck are you--
- No man, we're here right now!

1164
01:25:27,014 --> 01:25:28,891
We need to see if anybody's found him yet.

1165
01:25:34,488 --> 01:25:35,626
Over here!

1166
01:25:42,062 --> 01:25:45,134
- Fuck is that?
- Crabs. They're eating him.

1167
01:25:47,334 --> 01:25:51,805
- That's fuckin' sick. That's gross.

1168
01:25:52,873 --> 01:25:54,511
Nature sucks.

1169
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:03,121
There is blood on my shoe.

1170
01:26:03,183 --> 01:26:04,787
There's blood on my fuckin' shoe!

1171
01:26:06,153 --> 01:26:09,134
Some dog is gonna come down and dig this stuff up.

1172
01:26:09,189 --> 01:26:11,135
People do that. They bring their dogs here.

1173
01:26:11,191 --> 01:26:13,831
Even though it's illegal.
The lifeguards don't do shit.

1174
01:26:14,929 --> 01:26:16,033
If someone finds this stuff.

1175
01:26:16,096 --> 01:26:18,098
- If someone finds this stuff--
- Chill, Lisa.

1176
01:26:19,333 --> 01:26:21,313
You didn't do anything.

1177
01:26:21,368 --> 01:26:24,679
I was there, you didn't do anything. Neither did I.

1178
01:26:24,738 --> 01:26:25,773
Okay?

1179
01:26:27,074 --> 01:26:28,075
I definitely didn't.

1180
01:26:28,142 --> 01:26:30,645
- What?

1181
01:26:30,711 --> 01:26:32,782
I didn't kill anybody.
I just went along for the ride.

1182
01:26:32,846 --> 01:26:36,191
- You fuckin' drowned the guy!
- I only helped carry the body

1183
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:38,560
'cause that Mafia guy was gonna beat me.

1184
01:26:38,619 --> 01:26:40,826
- I didn't do shit.
- Neither did I.

1185
01:26:40,888 --> 01:26:43,232
- You stabbed him first!
- Fuck you!

1186
01:26:43,290 --> 01:26:47,466
- The blade went in like that much.
- What about the other 10 times?

1187
01:26:50,297 --> 01:26:52,368
God damn it, Lisa! Give me the bat back.

1188
01:26:52,433 --> 01:26:54,413
I got to return it or I gotta pay for it.

1189
01:27:21,628 --> 01:27:22,766
Where are the knives?

1190
01:27:24,264 --> 01:27:27,871
- I threw them in the ocean.
- You threw them where in the ocean?

1191
01:27:27,935 --> 01:27:30,381
The bitch's been going postal ever since you left.

1192
01:27:30,437 --> 01:27:31,711
She's crazy, thinks she's gonna get caught.

1193
01:27:31,772 --> 01:27:33,410
No, I didn't do shit!

1194
01:27:33,474 --> 01:27:35,249
If anyone gets caught, it'll be you.

1195
01:27:35,309 --> 01:27:36,617
You stabbed him first.

1196
01:27:36,677 --> 01:27:38,088
Shut up! I didn't do shit.

1197
01:27:38,145 --> 01:27:40,819
So we've been talking about
getting caught, and who did what.

1198
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:43,521
That's a great talk to have.
We need to have that talk.

1199
01:27:43,584 --> 01:27:45,257
So, what have you decided?

1200
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:53,796
You, doper? What do you think?

1201
01:27:53,861 --> 01:27:55,807
Did you kill that motherfucker?

1202
01:27:55,863 --> 01:27:56,841
<i>No.</i>

1203
01:27:56,897 --> 01:28:00,208
I mean, I stabbed the dude. I admit that.

1204
01:28:00,267 --> 01:28:02,804
Everyone saw me do that. But I didn't--

1205
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:04,679
I didn't actually kill him.

1206
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:07,082
He was still alive after I finished sticking him.

1207
01:28:07,141 --> 01:28:08,552
You saw the fucker run.

1208
01:28:08,609 --> 01:28:09,679
And you?

1209
01:28:11,111 --> 01:28:12,954
You know I didn't kill him.

1210
01:28:13,013 --> 01:28:15,220
Who helped me drown the son of bitch, then?

1211
01:28:15,282 --> 01:28:17,956
- He was dead already.
- Oh, he was dead?

1212
01:28:18,018 --> 01:28:20,225
He was <i>so</i> far fuckin' gone, man.

1213
01:28:21,288 --> 01:28:23,290
I just picked him up to help you move him.

1214
01:28:23,357 --> 01:28:27,100
I didn't-- I didn't kill anybody.

1215
01:28:28,662 --> 01:28:29,606
Ladies?

1216
01:28:31,632 --> 01:28:33,771
Of course not! You had nothing to do with it,

1217
01:28:33,834 --> 01:28:35,677
you were just our dates, correct?

1218
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:38,611
<i>Me and Mr. Marty have spoken...</i>

1219
01:28:38,672 --> 01:28:41,209
on the way to retrieving the sheath
that was left at the scene.

1220
01:28:41,275 --> 01:28:44,188
The murder scene. You understand
that we murdered somebody?

1221
01:28:44,244 --> 01:28:45,746
We took your friend's life!

1222
01:28:45,813 --> 01:28:47,486
I wanna make sure we're on the same page.

1223
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:51,220
I know you fuckin' smokeheads.

1224
01:28:51,285 --> 01:28:52,821
You're having your thrills and shit.

1225
01:28:52,886 --> 01:28:54,524
This is no fucking video game.

1226
01:28:54,588 --> 01:28:56,761
Your friend you were <i>so</i> very pissed at,

1227
01:28:56,824 --> 01:28:58,360
he's lying face down in the swamp,

1228
01:28:58,425 --> 01:29:01,201
with his eyes hanging out and the crabs eating him.

1229
01:29:01,261 --> 01:29:03,263
I don't intend on going down for this shit.

1230
01:29:03,330 --> 01:29:07,301
If any of you take me down,
I will kill his ass, or her ass.

1231
01:29:07,367 --> 01:29:10,143
We're gonna sit on this beach, right now,

1232
01:29:10,204 --> 01:29:13,344
and work out this alibi until I'm satisfied with it.

1233
01:29:13,407 --> 01:29:14,647
You've reached the Kents.

1234
01:29:14,708 --> 01:29:16,585
Please leave your name and number at the beep.

1235
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:18,384
We'll get back to you as soon as we can.

1236
01:29:18,445 --> 01:29:19,549
Have a good day.

1237
01:29:19,613 --> 01:29:22,219
Bobby, this is Marty Puccio.

1238
01:29:23,350 --> 01:29:25,023
I called you.

1239
01:29:25,085 --> 01:29:28,862
You asked me to call when I got home, <i>so</i> I'm calling.

1240
01:29:28,922 --> 01:29:29,957
Marty?

1241
01:29:49,576 --> 01:29:52,785
You think they could say I was guilty of it?

1242
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:54,257
I guess.

1243
01:29:56,884 --> 01:29:58,693
You stabbed him in the heart.

1244
01:29:58,752 --> 01:30:01,665
When you were on top of him and he was on his back.

1245
01:30:02,890 --> 01:30:06,030
No shit! I had that Mafia guy with a baseball bat

1246
01:30:06,093 --> 01:30:08,198
telling me what to do every minute.

1247
01:30:08,262 --> 01:30:09,935
Yeah, that's true.

1248
01:30:11,265 --> 01:30:13,836
I guess they'd say he did it.

1249
01:30:14,935 --> 01:30:18,348
No shit, Lisa! The guy bashed
his brains out with a ball bat.

1250
01:30:20,807 --> 01:30:21,877
Oh shit!

1251
01:30:23,377 --> 01:30:26,381
That was <i>so</i> gross!

1252
01:30:26,446 --> 01:30:29,984
And the guy goes like-- and the shit just--

1253
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:31,723
<i>That was so sick!</i>

1254
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:39,334
You don't think I could get in trouble?

1255
01:30:40,761 --> 01:30:42,069
For what?

1256
01:30:44,364 --> 01:30:46,571
For being there, like an accessory?

1257
01:30:49,002 --> 01:30:52,415
They could say that you were
a witness, but that's about it.

1258
01:30:52,472 --> 01:30:54,247
That's no big deal.

1259
01:30:59,446 --> 01:31:01,289
So, how do you feel?

1260
01:31:02,549 --> 01:31:05,223
- If we don't get caught?
- Yeah.

1261
01:31:05,285 --> 01:31:10,098
Shit, babe! I feel like
a ton of bricks got lifted off me.

1262
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:14,265
We did it.

1263
01:31:17,464 --> 01:31:19,671
We killed a guy.

1264
01:31:51,632 --> 01:31:53,771
Hey man, I heard. You're off the chain!

1265
01:31:53,834 --> 01:31:55,507
- What?
- You're out of hand.

1266
01:31:55,569 --> 01:31:56,707
The fuck you're talking about?

1267
01:31:56,770 --> 01:31:58,841
Fatalize, man. Fatalize.

1268
01:32:02,142 --> 01:32:05,783
I don't know, man. I'm just <i>so</i> uptight.

1269
01:32:05,846 --> 01:32:08,349
I can't sleep or do shit... It's like--

1270
01:32:09,516 --> 01:32:12,986
I'm worried they're gonna find
some shit that's gonna give us away.

1271
01:32:13,053 --> 01:32:15,090
I'm gonna... get caught.

1272
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:19,032
I'm <i>so</i> fucked! I just--

1273
01:32:19,092 --> 01:32:20,435
I just can't stop thinking about it.

1274
01:32:21,762 --> 01:32:23,469
You didn't kill that dude, did you?

1275
01:32:23,530 --> 01:32:25,669
No! Hell no! I didn't have shit to do with it.

1276
01:32:25,732 --> 01:32:27,075
But I was there.

1277
01:32:27,134 --> 01:32:29,341
Someone could say I was a witness.

1278
01:32:29,403 --> 01:32:33,476
I don't know. Maybe if you just know
that something like this happened,

1279
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:35,713
and you don't tell the cops,
they have some fuckin' law,

1280
01:32:35,776 --> 01:32:37,915
some fine print that could get you in trouble.

1281
01:32:37,978 --> 01:32:42,859
Like leaving the scene
of an accident and not reporting it.

1282
01:32:42,916 --> 01:32:44,759
Yeah, they have that in driver's ed.

1283
01:32:44,818 --> 01:32:47,731
I know. So, shit!

1284
01:32:48,722 --> 01:32:50,998
It's like... I just--

1285
01:32:51,058 --> 01:32:52,332
I need an alibi, man.

1286
01:32:53,827 --> 01:32:56,239
I need someone to say I was with him, so--

1287
01:32:56,296 --> 01:32:58,071
so, I could be like,

1288
01:32:58,131 --> 01:33:00,441
"No... I wasn't anywhere near
those assholes that night.

1289
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,173
I was nowhere near them."

1290
01:33:02,235 --> 01:33:04,010
Say this to who?

1291
01:33:04,071 --> 01:33:05,778
To the cops.

1292
01:33:07,507 --> 01:33:10,852
I need someone to say I was with them.

1293
01:33:17,084 --> 01:33:20,088
What kind of asshole is gonna lie
to the cops about a murder?

1294
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:32,039
Hey Lisa. What's up?

1295
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:36,044
You're not gonna believe this shit.
You're not gonna believe it.

1296
01:33:36,103 --> 01:33:37,411
We killed Bobby.

1297
01:33:37,471 --> 01:33:38,677
Pardon me?

1298
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:41,647
We killed him, he's dead. We did it.

1299
01:33:42,776 --> 01:33:46,121
You should've seen it.
Marty stuck him right in the heart.

1300
01:33:46,179 --> 01:33:48,159
Lisa, what are you talking about?

1301
01:33:48,215 --> 01:33:51,253
No shit, listen.

1302
01:33:51,318 --> 01:33:53,457
You know that guy Donny?

1303
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,431
You know, the loser? You met him.

1304
01:33:58,024 --> 01:34:01,403
He stuck him right in the back of the head.

1305
01:34:01,461 --> 01:34:03,338
Lisa, what?

1306
01:34:04,431 --> 01:34:06,604
It's <i>so</i> weird.

1307
01:34:06,666 --> 01:34:09,738
This hitman, right? He takes his baseball bat...

1308
01:34:09,803 --> 01:34:12,079
and right when Bobby's on the ground--

1309
01:34:13,106 --> 01:34:15,052
he's like gurgling like a baby--

1310
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:18,555
shooting blood and his guts are hanging out--

1311
01:34:20,347 --> 01:34:21,553
and his eyes--

1312
01:34:22,616 --> 01:34:25,290
It was <i>so</i> sick, his eyes were
popping out of his head.

1313
01:34:25,352 --> 01:34:28,060
He takes his baseball bat and he swings it,

1314
01:34:28,121 --> 01:34:30,192
and he half caves in his head.

1315
01:34:30,257 --> 01:34:31,895
You watched this?

1316
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:33,904
Yeah, I was there. And Ali and Heather.

1317
01:34:35,028 --> 01:34:36,006
We were all there.

1318
01:34:36,062 --> 01:34:38,303
And we saw it, most of it.

1319
01:34:38,365 --> 01:34:40,345
Heather, you met her, right?

1320
01:34:41,735 --> 01:34:43,737
She's <i>so</i> strange.

1321
01:34:43,804 --> 01:34:46,478
She gets that blank look, like she's not even there.

1322
01:34:46,540 --> 01:34:49,646
And she starts hugging her knees and rocking...

1323
01:34:49,709 --> 01:34:52,417
like she's totally fried. And then, after...

1324
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:54,982
<i>she just shrugs and says “Fuck them.“</i>

1325
01:35:04,157 --> 01:35:06,068
- Lisa--
- Listen, Claudia.

1326
01:35:07,294 --> 01:35:09,240
I'm really worried about how we left him.

1327
01:35:09,296 --> 01:35:11,572
He's just out there, where anyone can see him.

1328
01:35:11,631 --> 01:35:13,372
I can't stop thinking about it, you know?

1329
01:35:15,235 --> 01:35:17,772
Like someone walking up and finding him.

1330
01:35:18,939 --> 01:35:22,250
We should've hid him better,
pushed him in the canal more.

1331
01:35:22,309 --> 01:35:25,950
At least the gators would've got him
or he would have sunk, but--

1332
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:27,685
That's why I came over.

1333
01:35:27,747 --> 01:35:28,725
What?

1334
01:35:29,783 --> 01:35:32,525
Claudia, I need to go out there.

1335
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,893
Can you borrow your mother's car? I need a ride.

1336
01:35:35,956 --> 01:35:37,560
I need someone to help me move it.

1337
01:35:37,624 --> 01:35:39,831
- It?
- The body.

1338
01:35:42,295 --> 01:35:46,243
- You murdered Bobby Kent?
- I didn't say I murdered anybody.

1339
01:35:46,299 --> 01:35:50,543
They killed him. I won't even say they murdered him.

1340
01:35:50,604 --> 01:35:53,813
- He was fighting back.
- He was?

1341
01:35:53,874 --> 01:35:55,683
Yeah! He was trying to get away.

1342
01:35:55,742 --> 01:35:58,222
Begging Marty. You know,

1343
01:35:58,278 --> 01:36:03,250
saying, "I'm sorry, please.
I'll do anything, don't kill me."

1344
01:36:03,316 --> 01:36:05,057
Right when he said that,

1345
01:36:05,118 --> 01:36:07,223
Marty walked up to him

1346
01:36:07,287 --> 01:36:09,927
and whacked him in the heart with his diving knife.

1347
01:36:09,990 --> 01:36:13,164
The whole thing was just totally extreme!

1348
01:36:14,995 --> 01:36:16,531
Oh. Wait.

1349
01:36:16,596 --> 01:36:19,634
You want somebody to take you
out there to move a body?

1350
01:36:19,699 --> 01:36:23,146
I don't" anybody crazy enough to do that--

1351
01:36:23,203 --> 01:36:26,673
Fine, fine. We won't go move it.

1352
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:30,187
We'll just go out there see
if the tire tracks are gone.

1353
01:36:30,243 --> 01:36:32,519
No way, Lisa. No way.

1354
01:36:32,579 --> 01:36:34,820
- Come on!
- No!

1355
01:36:34,881 --> 01:36:37,521
Look, I gotta go. I'm late for work.

1356
01:36:37,584 --> 01:36:39,655
I'm supposed to be in Pizza Hut in half an hour.

1357
01:36:39,719 --> 01:36:43,496
Well, screw you, Claudia. All I wanted was a ride--

1358
01:36:44,658 --> 01:36:48,162
I hope you have a problem someday,
<i>so</i> you can ask me for help.

1359
01:36:48,228 --> 01:36:49,263
Shit!

1360
01:36:51,064 --> 01:36:53,305
You don't have to make a federal case out of it.

1361
01:36:53,366 --> 01:36:55,039
I just asked for a fuckin' ride.

1362
01:36:56,169 --> 01:36:58,479
Claudia, keep your fuckin' mouth shut.

1363
01:37:05,879 --> 01:37:07,825
Was that Lisa leaving?

1364
01:37:07,881 --> 01:37:09,053
Yeah.

1365
01:37:09,115 --> 01:37:11,527
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah!

1366
01:37:11,585 --> 01:37:14,794
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

1367
01:37:14,854 --> 01:37:17,130
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

1368
01:37:17,190 --> 01:37:19,136
I gotta go to work, Mom.

1369
01:37:22,729 --> 01:37:26,108
Mom, what if you witnessed a crime, like a murder,

1370
01:37:26,166 --> 01:37:29,613
and you called the hotline but didn't give your name.

1371
01:37:29,669 --> 01:37:31,205
Would that be legal?

1372
01:37:31,271 --> 01:37:33,046
I don't know what you mean, Ali.

1373
01:37:33,106 --> 01:37:35,450
What kind of a crime?

1374
01:37:35,508 --> 01:37:36,919
A murder, I told you.

1375
01:37:38,511 --> 01:37:40,752
What are you kids up to, Ali?

1376
01:37:40,814 --> 01:37:42,794
I was just asking, for Christ's sakes.

1377
01:37:42,849 --> 01:37:44,851
I mean, would it still count?

1378
01:37:44,918 --> 01:37:46,659
You could still say you reported it, right?

1379
01:37:48,355 --> 01:37:51,529
If you saw a murder, and just called the hotline,

1380
01:37:51,591 --> 01:37:54,071
and reported it and didn't give
your name or anything,

1381
01:37:54,127 --> 01:37:57,199
- would that be enough?
- Would it?

1382
01:37:57,263 --> 01:38:01,507
I don't know the law, but... I don't think so.

1383
01:38:01,568 --> 01:38:04,048
I think you would still have to say who you were.

1384
01:38:04,104 --> 01:38:06,641
- But why wouldn't it--
- Why are you asking these questions?

1385
01:38:06,706 --> 01:38:10,244
Why wouldn't it count?
You could still say you reported it.

1386
01:38:11,511 --> 01:38:13,957
Ali, are you talking about a "murder" murder?

1387
01:38:15,015 --> 01:38:18,019
I guess. This guy kind of got killed.

1388
01:38:18,084 --> 01:38:20,564
Why would you just call a hotline?

1389
01:38:20,620 --> 01:38:23,191
I was just asking, God!

1390
01:38:38,938 --> 01:38:40,178
Hello?

1391
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:41,981
Marty, where have you been?

1392
01:38:42,042 --> 01:38:44,147
Somebody made an anonymous call to the cops.

1393
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:45,746
They know about Bobby.

1394
01:38:45,812 --> 01:38:48,486
- Have they found him?
- I don't know.

1395
01:38:48,548 --> 01:38:50,391
Somebody told them he got murdered.

1396
01:38:50,450 --> 01:38:52,691
- Murdered?
- That's what they said.

1397
01:38:52,752 --> 01:38:55,255
- They used that word?
- Yes!

1398
01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:58,736
Did you fuckin' talk to somebody?

1399
01:38:58,792 --> 01:39:01,773
No, I didn't talk to anybody, Jesus!

1400
01:40:37,290 --> 01:40:40,999
- You're up early.
- I'm going to the skate park.

1401
01:40:42,228 --> 01:40:44,265
What did you do with the earring?

1402
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:45,832
It fell out.

1403
01:41:14,994 --> 01:41:16,473
I love you, buddy.

1404
01:41:17,597 --> 01:41:19,008
Yeah, I love you too.

1405
01:41:29,475 --> 01:41:31,079
Who the fuck did you tell, Lisa?

1406
01:41:31,144 --> 01:41:33,624
It wasn't me, bitch. For all I know, it's you.

1407
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:35,626
The cops are onto us, we have to come up there.

1408
01:41:35,682 --> 01:41:37,127
Not with police on you, you don't.

1409
01:41:37,183 --> 01:41:39,060
You gotta hide us.

1410
01:41:40,186 --> 01:41:43,065
They know how Bobby died and everything.

1411
01:41:43,122 --> 01:41:44,829
We're all in this together, right?

1412
01:41:56,035 --> 01:41:58,879
- Alice, geez!
- It's okay!

1413
01:41:58,938 --> 01:42:01,578
It's all right. I've got it under control.

1414
01:42:01,641 --> 01:42:03,621
I don't want them to know where I sleep.

1415
01:42:03,676 --> 01:42:07,385
- This is going to stop, right now.
- Move me in my own apartment then.

1416
01:42:07,447 --> 01:42:10,018
- An apartment?
- Godfucking damn it!

1417
01:42:10,083 --> 01:42:13,360
We need to hide because they're
gonna come to your house.

1418
01:42:13,419 --> 01:42:15,558
Baby, who are they?

1419
01:42:15,622 --> 01:42:18,865
Alice seems to think that
some of her friends killed somebody.

1420
01:42:19,959 --> 01:42:22,371
Who in the hell, Virginia?

1421
01:42:22,428 --> 01:42:24,999
- That is something for the police.
- No police, because

1422
01:42:25,064 --> 01:42:26,907
a Mafia hitman did this.

1423
01:42:26,966 --> 01:42:29,708
He said that if we told anybody, he'd kill us.

1424
01:42:29,769 --> 01:42:32,443
Is this about getting your own apartment?

1425
01:42:32,505 --> 01:42:35,952
- No! I don't want an apartment!
- Hey! Honey, hey.

1426
01:42:36,009 --> 01:42:37,488
Fuck.

1427
01:42:37,543 --> 01:42:38,749
- Don't touch me!
- Baby--

1428
01:42:38,811 --> 01:42:40,484
- Baby!
- Don't touch me!

1429
01:42:40,546 --> 01:42:43,049
- Ali, chill!

1430
01:42:44,350 --> 01:42:46,626
- That's it.
- He's not in the Mafia.

1431
01:42:46,686 --> 01:42:48,290
You don't know what you're talking about.

1432
01:42:48,354 --> 01:42:50,561
- He must be protecting you.
- Protecting me?

1433
01:42:50,623 --> 01:42:52,899
I'm his brother. That lazy fucker protects dick.

1434
01:42:52,959 --> 01:42:54,836
He doesn't have a job.

1435
01:42:54,894 --> 01:42:56,805
What about the Crazy Motherfuckers?

1436
01:42:56,863 --> 01:42:58,900
He wanted to be in Davy Boyz but chickened out.

1437
01:42:58,965 --> 01:43:00,501
Got the tattoo instead.

1438
01:43:00,566 --> 01:43:02,443
You ought to turn yourselves in.

1439
01:43:05,305 --> 01:43:07,911
But if I turn my self in, I may go to jail.

1440
01:43:07,974 --> 01:43:10,215
She's afraid they'll put her in jail.

1441
01:43:10,276 --> 01:43:13,723
- Tell her you'll write to her.
- Hey man, I'll write to you.

1442
01:43:34,567 --> 01:43:38,071
- Good toss, Laura--

1443
01:43:42,976 --> 01:43:44,887
Sheriff's office! Where is Marty?

1444
01:43:44,944 --> 01:43:46,946
Where is he? Let's go!

1445
01:43:52,986 --> 01:43:54,795
Sheriff's office, don't move.

1446
01:43:54,854 --> 01:43:57,027
- Where's Marty?
- In the bedroom.

1447
01:44:03,262 --> 01:44:04,935
- Sheriff's office!
- What's going on?

1448
01:44:04,998 --> 01:44:07,501
Does the name Bobby Kent ring a bell?

1449
01:44:17,310 --> 01:44:18,311
Hurry.

1450
01:45:08,861 --> 01:45:12,809
I'm due in seven weeks. If it's a boy,
I'll name him Marty.

1451
01:45:14,734 --> 01:45:16,645
Will you send me a picture?

1452
01:45:16,702 --> 01:45:17,737
Yeah.

1453
01:45:17,804 --> 01:45:20,410
Are they gonna let you out to have it?

1454
01:45:20,473 --> 01:45:22,475
Shut up, bitch. You're a fuckin' snitch.

1455
01:45:22,542 --> 01:45:24,283
You cut a deal. We all know that.

1456
01:45:25,344 --> 01:45:26,448
Is it true?

1457
01:45:27,547 --> 01:45:30,323
Shit, Ali. You don't know that yet?

1458
01:45:30,383 --> 01:45:32,863
Jesus, who is your lawyer?

1459
01:45:32,919 --> 01:45:36,423
Her and Dumbo here have been
snitching on us to save their asses,

1460
01:45:36,489 --> 01:45:38,332
otherwise we wouldn't be here today.

1461
01:45:38,391 --> 01:45:41,736
Psst! Sorry ass snitch motherfucker!

1462
01:45:41,794 --> 01:45:43,205
I know what you're doing.

1463
01:45:43,262 --> 01:45:46,300
- You're gonna regret this.
- Leave him alone, asshole!

1464
01:45:46,365 --> 01:45:47,901
You've done enough to ruin his life.

1465
01:45:47,967 --> 01:45:49,412
Shut the fuck up!

1466
01:45:49,469 --> 01:45:52,746
- Your fat cousin ruined it.
- I don't know what I'm doing here.

1467
01:45:52,805 --> 01:45:54,978
I didn't do shit. I don't know why I'm here.

1468
01:45:55,041 --> 01:45:56,019
You stabbed him, dude.
